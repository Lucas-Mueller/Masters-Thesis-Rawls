## 5. Consolidate Agent Creation

The `create_deliberation_agents` function in `enhanced.py` is responsible for creating the agents. This logic could be moved into the `DeliberationAgent` class itself.

**Problem:** Agent creation logic is separate from the agent class.

**Proposed Solution:** Move the agent creation logic into a class method on the `DeliberationAgent` class. This would make the `DeliberationAgent` class more self-contained.

**Justification:** This is a small change, but it would improve the organization of the code and make it easier to find the agent creation logic.
