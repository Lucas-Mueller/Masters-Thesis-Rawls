This way, we protect the worst-off, promote fairness, and prevent extreme inequality, aligning with our shared goal of a just, stable, and cohesive society.\n\nFor now, my current choice remains Principle 3, but I am open to exploring this hybrid approach to better address the broader concerns of fairness and stability.",
