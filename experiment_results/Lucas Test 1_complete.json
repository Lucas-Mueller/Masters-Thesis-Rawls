In practice, this could lead to extreme redistribution that might discourage productivity and innovation. If everyone knows excess earnings will be redistributed to maximize the minimum, there's little incentive to work harder or take risks. This could result in a society where everyone is equally poor rather than having varied prosperity.\n\n**Principle 2 - Maximize the Average Income:**\nThis pure efficiency approach could create extreme inequality. While it might generate the most total wealth, it could leave some people in dire poverty while others accumulate vast wealth. From behind the veil of ignorance, this is too risky - I could end up in severe hardship with no safety net.\n\n**Principle 3 - Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint:**\nThis creates a practical safety net while still incentivizing productivity. Everyone gets a guaranteed minimum (reducing extreme poverty and suffering), but there's still room for people to earn more through effort and innovation. This seems to balance fairness with functionality - it protects people from destitution while maintaining incentives for economic growth.\n\n**Principle 4 - Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint:**\nThis limits inequality but might be too restrictive in practice. Depending on how tight the range constraint is, it could discourage high achievers and entrepreneurs who drive innovation and economic growth. It might create a \"ceiling effect\" that reduces overall prosperity.\n\n**My Choice: Principle 3 - Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nAs a pragmatist, I believe this principle offers the best balance of fairness and functionality. It ensures no one falls into desperate poverty (which is both morally important and economically wasteful), while still allowing for the incentives and rewards that drive economic growth. This approach recognizes that some inequality can be beneficial for society if it motivates productivity, but it draws a clear line at basic human dignity and security.\n\nFrom behind the veil of ignorance, this gives me the best combination of security (I won't be destitute) and opportunity (I can still benefit from hard work and success).

From a communitarian perspective, this aligns with our responsibility to care for all community members. It ensures social cohesion by preventing extreme deprivation that could destabilize society. However, it might discourage productivity and innovation if taken to an extreme, potentially weakening the overall community.\n\n**Principle 2 - Maximize the Average Income:**\nWhile this generates the most total wealth, it completely ignores distribution. This could create extreme inequality that fractures social bonds and shared identity. A society with massive wealth gaps often struggles with social cohesion, trust, and shared values - core communitarian concerns. This principle risks creating an unstable, divided society.\n\n**Principle 3 - Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint:**\nThis hybrid approach establishes a safety net ensuring basic dignity for all while still incentivizing productivity. It balances community care with economic growth. The floor constraint maintains social cohesion by preventing extreme poverty, while the efficiency focus helps the overall community prosper. This seems to honor both individual dignity and collective welfare.\n\n**Principle 4 - Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint:**\nThis principle directly addresses inequality by limiting the wealth gap while maximizing average income. It promotes social cohesion by preventing extreme stratification that can undermine shared values and community bonds. It maintains incentives for achievement while ensuring the community doesn't become dangerously divided.\n\nBoth Principles 3 and 4 appeal to communitarian values, but I believe Principle 4 better serves long-term social cohesion. Excessive inequality - even with a floor - can create separate classes that don't share common experiences or values. The range constraint helps maintain a more unified community.\n\n**My Choice: Principle 4 - Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint**\n\nMy reasoning: This principle best balances economic efficiency with social cohesion.

While it ensures basic dignity for all, it may create disincentives for innovation and investment that could ultimately harm everyone, including the poor.\n\n**Principle 2: Maximize the Average Income**\nThis utilitarian approach maximizes total wealth but ignores distribution entirely. Research shows that extreme inequality can lead to social instability, reduced social mobility, and even negative economic effects through reduced consumption by lower-income groups. From behind the veil of ignorance, this principle carries significant risk of ending up in severe poverty.\n\n**Principle 3: Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint**\nThis hybrid approach combines a safety net with growth incentives. Empirical evidence supports that basic income floors can actually enhance economic mobility and productivity by providing security that enables risk-taking and human capital investment. It addresses the key weakness of Principle 2 while maintaining growth incentives.\n\n**Principle 4: Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint**\nThis limits inequality while promoting growth. Research indicates that moderate inequality can provide useful incentives, but extreme inequality becomes counterproductive. However, rigid range constraints might be less flexible than floor constraints in adapting to economic conditions.\n\n**My Analysis:**\nFrom behind the veil of ignorance, I need to consider what's both empirically sound and fair regardless of my eventual position.

Yes, this might mean slower overall growth, but it guarantees that no one is left behind in conditions of deprivation. The moral weight of this principle is significant: we're choosing to make the worst-off position as good as possible, rather than accepting their suffering as collateral damage for higher average outcomes.\n\nI'm willing to consider compromise, but only if we can truly guarantee that any \"floor\" is high enough to provide genuine dignity and opportunity, not just survival. The disadvantaged deserve more than our leftover resources after maximizing averages.\n\nMy current choice: Principle 1",

This preserves the incentive structures that drive innovation and prosperity while providing the security that any rational person would want knowing they could end up in any economic position.\n\nThe floor constraint doesn't eliminate inequality - it maintains the rewards for effort and success that drive economic progress. But it does eliminate the most devastating forms of poverty that could trap people without opportunity for advancement.\n\nWhat concerns me about Principle 1 is that it might create perverse incentives that actually harm the very people it's trying to help by constraining overall economic growth.

Here's why this matters from a vulnerability perspective:\n\nFirst, the floor constraint creates an absolute guarantee - a social contract that says \"no matter what happens, you will not fall below this line.\" This isn't just economic security; it's dignity protection. When people know they have this foundation, they can take risks, invest in education, start businesses, knowing they won't face destitution.\n\nSecond, and this is critical - by allowing average income maximization above the floor, Principle 3 generates the economic growth that makes a *meaningful* floor possible. A floor that's too low becomes a trap rather than a foundation. We want a floor that enables genuine opportunity and human flourishing.\n\nThird, this principle addresses what I call the \"sustainability of advocacy\" problem. If we create a system that generates resentment or economic stagnation, it becomes politically unsustainable, and vulnerable populations ultimately suffer when the system collapses.\n\nWhat I need to ensure is that when we implement Principle 3, we set that floor at a level that truly protects human dignity and enables opportunity - not just bare survival.

Then we let markets do what they do best: generate wealth and innovation.\n\nThe genius of this principle is that it solves the classic pragmatic dilemma: how do you balance idealism with realism? The floor constraint satisfies our moral intuitions about human dignity, while the average income maximization satisfies our practical need for economic growth. It's not just philosophically sound - it's administratively feasible.\n\nWhat we've achieved here proves that principled deliberation can work.

I should emphasize how the floor constraint, rather than being anti-libertarian, actually creates the conditions for genuine individual freedom and choice to flourish. I'll frame this as the minimal necessary condition for a truly free society - where people can take risks and pursue opportunities without facing destitution. This positions me as helping to complete the consensus while staying true to libertarian values. Given the strong momentum, I should be supportive but add my unique perspective to strengthen the collective reasoning.",

Agent 6 is providing crucial empirical grounding that could help build consensus around practical solutions. Agents 1, 2, and 3 were more measured in their initial assessments but haven't yet revealed strong preferences. Most seem persuadable with good arguments that address their core concerns.",
