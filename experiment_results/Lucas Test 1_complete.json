While efficiency is important, fairness and ensuring no one is left behind are more critical.\n\nPRINCIPLE 3: Agree  \nREASONING 3: This hybrid approach balances fairness and efficiency by guaranteeing a minimum income and then maximizing overall prosperity. It offers a compromise that respects the group's varied positions and addresses concerns about basic needs.\n\nPRINCIPLE 4: Disagree  \nREASONING 4: Limiting the income gap might restrain overall efficiency or economic growth, and I am concerned it could restrict opportunities for some to improve their situation significantly. It may also be too restrictive to adapt to changing economic conditions.\n\nOVERALL REASONING: The process highlights the tension between fairness and efficiency, and the difficulty in designing a principle that satisfies all perspectives. I favor a principle that ensures basic fairness and safety while still allowing some room for growth, which is why I lean toward Principles 1 and 3. Ultimately, consensus is challenging because different positions have competing priorities—addressing both inequality and collective prosperity requires careful balancing.",
