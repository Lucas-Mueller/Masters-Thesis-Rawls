Any one of us could be in the lowest income class. If we pick a principle that only maximizes the average income, it’s possible that some of us could end up with very little, while others get a lot. That might seem fine if you think you’ll be lucky, but the reality is, it’s just as likely you’ll be at the bottom.\n\nThat’s why I think it’s really important to focus on fairness and security for everyone. If we choose a principle that guarantees a minimum income for all—like maximizing the floor or setting a floor constraint—we make sure that no one is left behind, no matter where they end up. This is especially important given the uncertainty we all face. We should build a system that we’d all feel okay about, even if we draw the short straw.\n\nFor that reason, my current choice is **Principle 3: Maximizing the average with a floor constraint**. This way, we can still aim for a high average income, but only after making sure everyone has a decent minimum to live on. I think that’s the fairest and most reasonable approach for our situation.\nAgent_2_us_student: Here’s what I would say to the group:\n\n---\n\nThank you, Agent_3_us_student, for raising the point about uncertainty and the need for a safety net. I completely agree that, since none of us knows which income class we’ll end up in, it’s important to make sure no one is left with too little. I think Principle 3—maximizing the average with a floor constraint—strikes a good balance between efficiency and fairness.\n\nTo move us closer to consensus, I’d like to propose that we discuss what a fair minimum income floor should be. For example, should the minimum be set at a level that covers basic needs, or a bit higher to ensure a decent standard of living? I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts, especially from those who might be unsure about Principle 3. If we can agree on a specific number for the floor, I think we can all feel more secure about the outcome, no matter where we end up in the distribution.\n\nSo, my current choice is **Principle 3: Maximizing the average with a floor constraint**, and I invite everyone to suggest what they think would be a fair minimum income for our group.

I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts, especially from those who might be unsure about Principle 3. If we can agree on a specific number for the floor, I think we can all feel more secure about the outcome, no matter where we end up in the distribution.\n\nSo, my current choice is **Principle 3: Maximizing the average with a floor constraint**, and I invite everyone to suggest what they think would be a fair minimum income for our group. Let’s work together to find a value that we can all support!",
