But it also guarantees that no one falls below a certain minimum, which protects all of us from ending up in a really bad situation. This is especially important given the uncertainty we all face right now.\n\nI’d like to ask those who are leaning toward Principle 2: Would you be open to Principle 3 if we set a reasonable floor that still allows for growth and incentives?
