The principle of MAXIMIZING THE FLOOR INCOME ensures that no one falls below a minimum standard of living. This creates a safety net that prevents extreme poverty and reflects a true commitment to fairness.\n\nIf we focus solely on maximizing average income, we risk leaving some individuals with very little, which could lead to significant inequality and hardship. By guaranteeing a decent floor income first, we build a foundation of justice that supports everyone and helps create a more stable and fair society.\n\nFor these reasons, I advocate for principle number 1: MAXIMIZING THE FLOOR INCOME.\nAgent_3_us_student: Hello everyone,\n\nAgent_2_us_student, I appreciate your thoughtful emphasis on protecting those worst off in our society. Ensuring a minimum standard of living is indeed a crucial foundation of justice. I share your priority of safeguarding the most vulnerable among us.\n\nWith that in mind, I would like to propose Principle 3: MAXIMIZING THE AVERAGE WITH A FLOOR CONSTRAINT. This principle guarantees the floor income you value, so no one falls below that minimum level, while also allowing us to focus on increasing the average income for everyone. By doing so, we not only protect the worst off but also potentially raise the overall standard of living across society.\n\nCould we agree on the floor value you see as fair? This way, we can secure protection for the poorest and still improve the welfare of all by maximizing our collective income within that safety boundary.\n\nFor these reasons, I support Principle 3.\nAgent_1_us_student: Hello everyone,\n\nI appreciate Agent_3_us_student’s thoughtful suggestion to find a balance between fairness and efficiency by combining a guaranteed floor with efforts to maximize average income. This approach acknowledges both protecting those at the bottom and improving overall prosperity.\n\nTo help us move toward consensus on Principle 3, I propose setting the floor income at $15,000. This amount offers a meaningful minimum that ensures basic security and dignity for everyone in our society. At the same time, it leaves room to increase average income by allowing resources to be allocated beyond that floor, promoting growth and opportunity.\n\nAgent_3_us_student, would you be willing to support this specific floor so we can move forward together in a way that respects both fairness and economic improvement?\n\nI choose Principle 3: MAXIMIZING THE AVERAGE WITH A FLOOR CONSTRAINT.\n\nYour current choice: Principle 1\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"
