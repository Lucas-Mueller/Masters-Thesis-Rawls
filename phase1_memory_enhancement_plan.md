# Phase 1 Memory Enhancement Plan

## Problem Statement

Currently, Phase 1 (Individual Familiarization) operates without memory generation or storage, creating a significant gap in agent continuity between individual and group phases. Agents enter Phase 2 with no internal memory of their Phase 1 reasoning, strategic insights, or learning from economic outcomes.

## Current State Analysis

### Phase 1 Memory Gap Issues

1. **No Strategic Continuity**: Agents cannot build on insights from individual application rounds
2. **Lost Preference Evolution**: Reasoning behind preference ranking changes isn't preserved
3. **Missing Economic Learning**: Reflections on income outcomes and principle applications are lost
4. **Fresh Start Problem**: Phase 2 begins without context from individual experiences
5. **Reduced Research Value**: Individual learning processes aren't captured for analysis

### Current Phase 1 Activities (No Memory)
- Initial preference ranking
- Detailed examples review  
- Individual application rounds (4 rounds by default)
- Post-examples preference ranking
- Post-individual preference ranking

## Solution Architecture

### Core Design Principles

1. **Preserve Individual Agency**: Phase 1 memories should reflect personal reasoning, not group dynamics
2. **Enhance Phase Transition**: Create meaningful bridge between individual and group experiences
3. **Maintain Research Integrity**: Capture learning processes for academic analysis
4. **Flexible Implementation**: Support existing memory strategies with Phase 1 extensions

### Proposed Memory Types for Phase 1

#### 1. Individual Reflection Memory
**Purpose**: Capture reasoning behind preference changes and economic decisions

**Content Structure**:
```yaml
reflection_type: "preference_evolution" | "economic_outcome" | "principle_application"
situation: "Description of current decision context"
reasoning: "Agent's internal reasoning process"
insights: "Key insights or learnings"
confidence_level: "Agent's confidence in current understanding"
```

#### 2. Learning Accumulation Memory
**Purpose**: Build understanding across multiple individual rounds

**Content Structure**:
```yaml
learning_type: "principle_understanding" | "economic_impact" | "strategic_development"
accumulated_knowledge: "Growing understanding of principles"
pattern_recognition: "Patterns noticed across rounds"
strategic_evolution: "How strategy has evolved"
```

#### 3. Experience Integration Memory
**Purpose**: Connect detailed examples with practical application

**Content Structure**:
```yaml
integration_type: "example_to_practice" | "outcome_analysis"
example_insights: "Insights from detailed examples"
practical_application: "How insights applied in individual rounds"
outcome_evaluation: "Assessment of economic results"
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Memory Infrastructure

#### 1.1 Extend Memory Service (`src/maai/services/memory_service.py`)

**New Methods**:
```python
async def generate_individual_reflection(
    agent: DeliberationAgent,
    reflection_context: IndividualReflectionContext
) -> IndividualMemoryEntry

async def update_individual_learning(
    agent: DeliberationAgent, 
    learning_context: LearningContext
) -> None

async def integrate_phase1_experience(
    agent: DeliberationAgent,
    experience_data: Phase1ExperienceData
) -> None
```

#### 1.2 Create Phase 1 Memory Models (`src/maai/core/models.py`)

**New Data Models**:
```python
class IndividualMemoryEntry(BaseModel):
    memory_id: str
    agent_id: str
    phase: Literal["individual"]
    memory_type: IndividualMemoryType
    content: IndividualMemoryContent
    timestamp: datetime
    round_context: Optional[int] = None

class IndividualMemoryType(str, Enum):
    REFLECTION = "reflection"
    LEARNING = "learning"  
    INTEGRATION = "integration"

class IndividualMemoryContent(BaseModel):
    situation_assessment: str
    reasoning_process: str
    insights_gained: str
    confidence_level: float
    strategic_implications: Optional[str] = None
```

#### 1.3 Extend Memory Strategies

**Enhanced Recent Strategy**:
- Include Phase 1 memories in Phase 2 context
- Separate individual vs group memory weighting

**Enhanced Decomposed Strategy**:
- Phase 1: Individual reflection prompts
- Phase 2: Include Phase 1 insights in group strategy

### Phase 2: Integration Points

#### 2.1 Initial Preference Ranking Memory
**Location**: `src/maai/services/experiment_orchestrator.py:_collect_initial_preference_ranking`

**Enhancement**:
```python
# After collecting initial preferences
await self.memory_service.generate_individual_reflection(
    agent=agent,
    reflection_context=IndividualReflectionContext(
        activity="initial_ranking",
        preferences=ranking_response,
        reasoning="Why did I rank principles this way?"
    )
)
```

#### 2.2 Detailed Examples Memory
**Location**: `src/maai/services/experiment_orchestrator.py:_present_detailed_examples`

**Enhancement**:
```python
# After each principle's examples
await self.memory_service.update_individual_learning(
    agent=agent,
    learning_context=LearningContext(
        principle=principle,
        examples_shown=examples,
        understanding_evolution="How has my understanding changed?"
    )
)
```

#### 2.3 Individual Application Rounds Memory
**Location**: `src/maai/services/experiment_orchestrator.py:_run_individual_round_for_agent`

**Enhancement**:
```python
# After economic outcomes
await self.memory_service.integrate_phase1_experience(
    agent=agent,
    experience_data=Phase1ExperienceData(
        round_number=round_num,
        principle_choice=choice,
        economic_outcome=outcome,
        reflection_prompt="What did I learn from this outcome?"
    )
)
```

### Phase 3: Phase Transition Bridge

#### 3.1 Memory Consolidation
**New Method**: `consolidate_phase1_memories()`

**Purpose**: Before Phase 2, create summary memory of Phase 1 insights

**Implementation**:
```python
async def consolidate_phase1_memories(self, agent_id: str) -> ConsolidatedMemory:
    """Create summary of Phase 1 learning for Phase 2 context"""
    individual_memories = self.get_agent_individual_memories(agent_id)
    
    consolidation_prompt = """
    Review your individual learning experiences:
    {individual_memories}
    
    Summarize:
    1. Key insights about distributive justice principles
    2. Strategic preferences developed through experience  
    3. Important patterns noticed in economic outcomes
    """
    
    # Generate consolidated memory entry
```

#### 3.2 Phase 2 Context Enhancement
**Location**: `src/maai/services/conversation_service.py:get_conversation_context`

**Enhancement**: Include Phase 1 consolidated memory in Phase 2 agent context

### Phase 4: Configuration and Testing

#### 4.1 Configuration Options
**New YAML fields**:
```yaml
phase1_memory:
  enable_individual_reflection: true
  reflection_frequency: "each_ranking"  # "each_ranking" | "each_round" | "phase_end"
  learning_accumulation: true
  experience_integration: true
  consolidation_strategy: "summary" # "summary" | "detailed" | "key_insights"

memory_strategy: "phase_aware_decomposed"  # New strategy that handles both phases
```

#### 4.2 Testing Strategy
**New Test Files**:
- `tests/test_phase1_memory.py`: Individual memory generation
- `tests/test_phase_transition.py`: Memory consolidation and bridge

## Conclusion

This enhancement addresses a significant gap in the current experimental framework by providing agents with memory continuity between individual and group phases. The implementation preserves the integrity of both phases while enabling more sophisticated analysis of agent learning and decision-making processes.

The modular design ensures backward compatibility while opening new research possibilities for understanding how individual experience influences group deliberation in distributive justice contexts.
