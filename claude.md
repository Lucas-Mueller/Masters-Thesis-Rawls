Design Principles: 
Simplistic code
Code should be concise and easy to understand. 
I have a great understanding of python intermediate skills in HTML and CSS but are open to learn new langauges and frameworks if they bring value. 
Keep the code simple but effective
Create modular code 
Adapt the file strucutre if needed
Ask questions back if you are unsure
Make improvements for suggestions 
Be open to challgenge me 
Document everything in the code
Create test for crucial components
Keep in mind that I want to host this project at some point via a Cloud provider like AWS
Create Unit test for subsystems 
Always challenge yourself to create simple and easy to understand code
