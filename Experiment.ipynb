    "- **Two-Phase Structure**: Individual Familiarization + Group Deliberation\n",
    "- **Economic Incentives**: Real monetary payouts based on income assignments\n",
    "- **Preference Rankings**: 1-4 rankings with certainty levels (not Likert scales)\n",
    "- **Income Distributions**: Multiple scenarios with 5 income classes each\n",
