The real moral imperative is to create a society where *everyone* can flourish, not just survive. By maximizing average income (with a reasonable floor, as in Principle 3), we ensure robust growth and opportunity, which in turn provides *more resources* to help the least advantaged. Why settle for a society where everyone is equally poor, when we could have one where everyone‚Äîincluding the worst-off‚Äîis genuinely better off?‚Äù\n",
