Of course. Here is a precise and concise description of the "Choosing Justice" experiment, designed for a developer to implement using agents.

### **Experiment Objective**

To determine which principle of distributive justice a group of autonomous agents will unanimously select when they are made impartial by a "veil of ignorance."

### **Experimental Design**

#### **1. The Participants**
The experiment is conducted with groups of five agents.

#### **2. The Conditions of Choice**
* **Impartiality:** Agents choose a principle without any knowledge of the specific economic position they will occupy. They are only told that their position (from best-off to worst-off) will be randomly assigned to them *after* their group makes its decision.
* **The Principles:** Agents must choose from one of four possible principles to govern their society's economic distribution:
    1.  **Maximize the Minimum Income:** The principle that ensures the worst-off member of society is as well-off as possible.
    2.  **Maximize the Average Income:** The principle that ensures the greatest possible total income for the group, without regard for its distribution.
    3.  **Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint:** A hybrid principle that establishes a minimum guaranteed income (a "safety net") for everyone, and then maximizes the average income.
    4.  **Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint:** A hybrid principle that limits the gap between the richest and poorest members, and then maximizes the average income.

### **Experimental Procedure**

#### **Step 1: Familiarization**
Each agent is individually presented with a clear and neutral description of the four principles of justice, including simple numerical examples to illustrate how each one functions.

#### **Step 2: Deliberation and Unanimous Choice**
* The group of five agents is placed in a shared communication channel.
* They are instructed to discuss the merits of the four principles until they reach a **unanimous agreement** on one.
* They are informed that failure to reach unanimity will result in a less desirable outcome (e.g., a random and potentially low-paying distribution), creating a strong incentive to agree.
* All communication between the agents is recorded. Each agent's formal preference after discussion is also recorded.

#### **Step 3: Economic Production and Redistribution**
* After a principle is chosen, the agents engage in a task that generates an economic output, resulting in a range of unequal earnings.
* Each agent is then **randomly assigned** to one of the earning positions (e.g., one agent becomes the highest earner, another the lowest, etc.).
* The group's unanimously chosen principle is then applied to the earnings, redistributing the initial income to determine each agent's final payoff.

### **Data to be Recorded**

1.  **Deliberation Content:** The complete transcript of the discussion among the agents.
2.  **Choice Outcome:** The principle of justice unanimously selected by each group.
3.  **Post-Experiment Feedback:** After receiving their final payoff, each agent is to be individually asked to report:
    * Their level of satisfaction with the group's choice.
    * Their assessment of the fairness of the chosen principle.
    * Whether they would make the same choice again.

### **Key Experimental Variations for Further Testing**

To ensure the results are robust, the experiment should be repeatable with the following modifications:

* **Decision Rule:** Change the requirement from unanimity to a **majority rule**.
* **Imposed Principle:** Instead of the agents choosing, **impose a principle** upon the group and compare their subsequent task performance and satisfaction to groups that chose their own principle.
