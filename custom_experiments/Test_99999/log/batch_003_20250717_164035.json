By maximizing the minimum income, we ensure that even the poorest among us are given a fair chance at a decent life. This approach promotes social stability and fairness, especially given our veil of ignorance—since we could end up in any economic position, it’s rational to choose a principle that protects everyone, including ourselves. While efficiency and overall wealth are important, they should not come at the expense of fairness and the risk of extreme inequality. Therefore, I advocate for Principle 1: Maximize the Minimum Income.\n\nYour current choice: Principle 1\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group?
