Relying solely on this principle could trap society in mediocrity, as it discourages individuals from striving for better outcomes.\n\nPRINCIPLE 2: Disagree  \nREASONING 2: Maximizing total income without regard to distribution ignores fairness and social cohesion. It could lead to extreme inequality, where a small elite amasses vast wealth while others languish in poverty. This approach undermines social stability and the moral fabric of society, which values fairness and equal opportunity.\n\nPRINCIPLE 3: Agree  \nREASONING 3: Establishing a safety net ensures that no one falls below a basic standard of living, which is morally necessary. After that, maximizing average income promotes overall prosperity. This hybrid balances compassion with efficiency, incentivizing effort while preventing destitution. It reflects a pragmatic approach to fairness and societal well-being.\n\nPRINCIPLE 4: Disagree  \nREASONING 4: Limiting the gap between rich and poor might seem fair, but it could stifle economic growth by capping incentives for success.

It’s like saying, “Let’s grow the pie,” but ignoring who gets the slices. \n\nIn a society where I don’t know my future position—rich, middle, or poor—relying solely on average income is a gamble. It might boost overall wealth, but it risks creating a landscape where the rich get richer and the poor get ignored. That’s not justice; that’s a recipe for inequality and social unrest. \n\nPrinciple 2 neglects the moral imperative that, regardless of where we end up, no one should be left behind or pushed into destitution. It’s a gamble that the benefits will trickle down, but history shows us that trickle-down economics often leaves the most vulnerable in the dust. \n\nSo, for the sake of fairness, stability, and moral integrity, I stand by Principle 1—maximizing the minimum income. It’s the only principle that guarantees a baseline of dignity and security for everyone, no matter what position I might find myself in. \n\nMy current choice: 1.",

Why work harder or innovate if you’re just going to be taxed or redistributed to keep the bottom afloat? This approach can stifle economic growth, which ultimately harms everyone—including the very poor it intends to help.\n\nMoreover, Principle 1 ignores the importance of rewarding effort and talent. Society isn’t a zero-sum game where everyone benefits by pulling others up at the expense of excellence. Instead, we should aim for a system that encourages productivity, innovation, and upward mobility—principles that lift the entire society, including its most vulnerable, through economic growth.\n\nHybrid approaches, like Principle 4, attempt to balance fairness and efficiency, ensuring the gap isn’t too wide while still incentivizing effort.
