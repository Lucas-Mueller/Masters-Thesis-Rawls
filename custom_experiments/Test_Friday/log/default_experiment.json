I want to acknowledge the merits in the other agents’ principles, highlighting common ground in guaranteeing minimum protection and encouraging growth.

Framing this principle as the best current compromise invites others to join or suggest refinements, moving us toward unanimous agreement and avoiding the poor outcome.\n\nSPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_2: Fellow agents,\n\nAs we consider how to design a just society behind the veil of ignorance—where any of us might end up rich, middle class, or poor—I believe it’s crucial to focus on protecting the most vulnerable while still fostering overall prosperity.\n\nPurely maximizing the minimum income certainly ensures the worst-off are better, but it may limit total growth and opportunity. On the other hand, maximizing average income without constraints risks leaving some extremely disadvantaged. To me, hybrid principles that establish a safety net or limit inequality strike the best balance. They protect everyone’s downside—guaranteeing no one falls below a secure floor or that disparities don’t become too extreme—while still encouraging innovation, effort, and overall wealth creation.\n\nThis compromise promotes fairness and security for all, regardless of future position, and offers a strong foundation for trust in our social system. I’m very open to hearing your perspectives and working together to find the best society we can.\n\nFor now, I support Principle 1—maximizing the minimum income—to ensure the worst-off have solid protection, and I hope we can explore how hybrid approaches might improve this further.\nAgent_3: Fellow agents,\n\nI appreciate Agent_2’s commitment to protecting the most vulnerable members of our society. Ensuring a strong foundation for those who may be worst-off is indeed crucial, especially since behind the veil of ignorance, none of us knows our eventual place.\n\nBuilding on that, I believe we should also consider how to balance fairness with opportunity for overall prosperity. Purely maximizing the minimum income could limit growth and innovation that benefits everyone, while maximizing average income without limits risks excessive inequality that undermines social cohesion.\n\nThat’s why I propose Principle 4: Maximize the average income while limiting the income gap. This approach guarantees that the range between the richest and poorest is controlled, preventing extreme disparities that can breed resentment and harm social stability. At the same time, it encourages economic growth by rewarding effort and innovation, which helps raise overall wealth.\n\nBy limiting the gap, everyone—not just the worst-off—is given a fair chance at a decent life, no matter their position. This balance offers security without sacrificing ambition, making it a prudent and just choice behind the veil of ignorance.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts as we aim for consensus.\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\nAgent_1: Fellow agents,\n\nThank you both for your thoughtful perspectives. I completely agree that protecting the worst-off is essential given the uncertainty behind the veil of ignorance, and that fostering overall prosperity matters greatly to sustain and improve our society.\n\nBuilding on your points, I suggest Principle 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—as a balanced path forward. This ensures everyone enjoys a guaranteed safety net, addressing Agent_2’s concern for firm protection of the least advantaged without sacrificing the incentive and potential for growth that comes with maximizing average income. It also avoids the complexity of strictly limiting the income gap, as Agent_3 proposes, yet still promotes fairness by ensuring no one falls below a set minimum.\n\nBy combining security with opportunity, this principle aligns with our shared goals: to create a society that is fair, just, and prosperous for all members—regardless of where fate places them.\n\nI invite your feedback on this hybrid approach, aiming to find consensus that secures both dignity for the worst-off and ambition for collective progress.\n\nMy current choice: 3\n\nYour current choice: Principle 1\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group?

Like you, I agree that since we do not know our future economic position, it is paramount to guarantee everyone a measure of security. Principle 1’s focus on the worst-off provides a vital foundation, while Principle 4’s range constraint thoughtfully addresses inequality—both aiming squarely at fairness.\n\nAt the same time, I see great value in encouraging prosperity that benefits everyone. Exclusively maximizing the minimum could risk stagnation, and strictly limiting the income gap might add complexity that hinders growth. That is why I find Principle 3—the combined approach with a clear floor—particularly compelling. It pragmatically ensures a safety net protecting all from falling too low, while still allowing society to pursue innovations and advances that raise overall well-being.\n\nMoreover, I am open to incorporating elements of the range limit if it helps us reach consensus and deepen fairness. Ultimately, my priority is protecting security behind the veil of ignorance while enabling collective prosperity.\n\nWith this in mind, I support Principle 3 as the best current compromise and invite us to work together to refine it for unanimous agreement.\n\nMy current choice: 3"
