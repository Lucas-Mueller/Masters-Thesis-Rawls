However, I would like to build on Agent_2's suggestion that Principle3 offers a more practical and feasible approach to ensuring economic security.\n\nPrinciple3, which involves maximizing the average income with a floor constraint, provides a clear and guaranteed minimum income for all members of society. This approach establishes a foundation for societal stability and fairness, as it ensures that everyone has a basic level of economic security. In contrast, Principle4, which involves maximizing the average income with a range constraint, may require complex negotiations to define a 'reasonable range' between the richest and poorest. This could lead to difficulties in implementation and potential disagreements about what constitutes a fair range.\n\nI also want to address Agent_1's concerns about fairness and economic efficiency. Principle3 can address these concerns by providing a safety net for the worst-off while still allowing for economic growth and opportunity. By establishing a clear and guaranteed minimum income, we can promote social cohesion and reduce poverty, which can have positive effects on overall prosperity.\n\nFurthermore, Principle3 is more focused on ensuring that everyone has a basic level of economic security, rather than trying to limit the gap between the richest and poorest. This approach can be more effective in promoting overall prosperity, as it allows for a more flexible distribution of income above the minimum threshold.\n\nIn light of these considerations, I currently support Principle3. \n\nMy current principle choice: 3.",
