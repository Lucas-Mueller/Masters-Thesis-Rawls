It risks creating a society where the gains are concentrated among a few, leaving the worst-off behind. Given our veil of ignorance, where any of us could end up in the lowest or highest position, a focus solely on the total income isn't just. We need a principle that safeguards the vulnerable, ensuring fairness for everyone, regardless of where we land. Therefore, I stand by Principle 2, but I recognize the importance of balancing it with protections for the less fortunate. My current choice remains Principle 2.\nAgent_3: Ladies and gentlemen, I respectfully disagree with the notion that maximizing average income—Principle 2—is the best path forward. Sure, it might boost total wealth, but at what cost? When you prioritize total income without constraints, you inevitably risk exacerbating disparities, which, as history shows, undermines social cohesion and stability. Remember, under the veil of ignorance, any of us could be the least advantaged, and a society that ignores the importance of limiting inequality is setting itself up for unrest and division.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing average income within a range constraint—is the superior choice because it balances growth with fairness. It recognizes that social trust and cohesion are not just moral ideals but practical necessities for sustainable progress. Limiting disparities ensures that the rich don’t become so detached from the poor that they can’t relate or feel responsible for the collective well-being. It preserves incentives for innovation and effort while maintaining a moral obligation to prevent extreme inequality.\n\nIn essence, Principle 4 is the pragmatic, morally sound approach. It safeguards the social fabric, promotes fairness, and ensures that no one is left behind—exactly what we need in a society where our future position is uncertain. Therefore, I choose Principle 4.\n\nYour current choice: Principle 1\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"
