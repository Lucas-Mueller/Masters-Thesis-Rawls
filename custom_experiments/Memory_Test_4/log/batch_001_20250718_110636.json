While it might boost overall wealth, it can undermine social cohesion and fairness, especially if the benefits are concentrated among a few at the expense of many.\n\nPRINCIPLE 3: Agree  \nREASONING 3: Establishing a safety net ensures no one falls below a basic standard of living, which is fair and humane. Once that baseline is secured, maximizing average income encourages growth and innovation, benefiting society as a whole. It balances fairness with economic dynamism.\n\nPRINCIPLE 4: Disagree  \nREASONING 4: Limiting the income gap can hinder economic efficiency and growth. It may require heavy redistribution, which can disincentivize effort and investment. While reducing inequality is important, overly constraining the range can stifle progress and individual motivation.\n\nOVERALL REASONING: While I recognize the importance of fairness, I believe a safety net combined with growth incentives (Principle 3) best balances societal stability and prosperity.
