      "output": "PRINCIPLE 1: Strongly Disagree  \nREASONING 1: The idea of maximizing the minimum income, while superficially compassionate, is fundamentally flawed. It incentivizes mediocrity by prioritizing the bottom rung at the expense of overall societal progress. If we always focus on the worst-off, we risk stifling innovation and productivity because resources are disproportionately redirected to those who may not contribute as much to economic growth. This is the classic \"race to the bottom\" scenario, where the bar is set so low that nobody is encouraged to reach higher.\n\nPRINCIPLE 2: Strongly Disagree  \nREASONING 2: Maximizing the average income, regardless of distribution, is a recipe for massive inequality and social instability. This principle essentially says, \"Let’s make the pie as big as possible, even if most people get crumbs.\" Not only does this breed resentment and undermine social cohesion, but it also ignores the diminishing marginal utility of income—the fact that extra dollars mean less to the ultra-rich than to the poor. It’s a mathematically elegant but morally bankrupt approach.\n\nPRINCIPLE 3: Disagree  \nREASONING 3: While this hybrid principle tries to have its cake and eat it too by establishing a floor, it still fundamentally prioritizes maximizing averages over genuine fairness. The floor constraint is a band-aid, not a solution; it simply prevents absolute destitution while allowing inequality to flourish unchecked above the minimum. This creates a two-tiered society: a protected underclass and a privileged elite, with little regard for the social consequences of such stratification.\n\nPRINCIPLE 4: Disagree  \nREASONING 4: Imposing a range constraint—limiting the gap between richest and poorest—sounds appealing, but it’s an arbitrary restriction that ignores the complexities of merit, effort, and contribution. It risks punishing success and discouraging ambition. Furthermore, it introduces bureaucratic inefficiencies as the state polices income gaps, which historically leads to economic stagnation and lack of innovation. Attempting to engineer equality of outcome, rather than equality of opportunity, is a guaranteed way to hamstring a society’s potential.\n\nOVERALL REASONING: All four principles are, frankly, deeply problematic from a rational and ethical standpoint. They either incentivize mediocrity, ignore the realities of human motivation, or attempt to artificially engineer outcomes in ways that undermine both liberty and prosperity. The only just system is one that maximizes opportunity—not outcomes—allowing individuals to reap the rewards of their own efforts while providing a minimal safety net for those truly in need. None of these principles sufficiently address the importance of personal responsibility, incentive structures, or the dangers of overbearing redistribution. In short: they’re all suboptimal.",

Agent_3, you keep insisting that maximizing the average income is the golden ticket for everyone—“a rising tide lifts all boats,” right? But let’s actually look at what happens when we follow that logic to its conclusion.\n\nSuppose we have a society of 10 people. Nine of them have $10 each, and one person has $1,000. The average income? $109. Now, let’s say the richest person doubles their wealth to $2,000 while the other nine remain at $10. The average jumps to $209. Wow, the average went up! But did the typical person’s life improve? Not at all. In fact, for 90% of the population, nothing changed. The gap between rich and poor just ballooned.\n\nSo, maximizing the average income doesn’t guarantee that the worst-off—or even the majority—are any better off. It’s mathematically possible, even likely, that the average can skyrocket while the bottom stays stagnant or falls behind. If you end up behind the veil of ignorance as one of the nine, you’re left holding the bag.\n\nNow, compare that with maximizing the average income but with a floor constraint—a guaranteed minimum. This doesn’t throw growth out the window; it just ensures nobody gets left behind. It’s not about punishing success, it’s about recognizing that a just society doesn’t leave its most vulnerable to fend for themselves.\n\nIf you actually care about justice and not just statistical window-dressing, you need that floor. Otherwise, you’re just rolling the dice and hoping you don’t end up on the losing side. So, let’s be rational, let’s be fair, and let’s not confuse averages with justice.\n\nMy choice remains: Principle 3."

The gap between rich and poor just ballooned.\n\nSo, maximizing the average income doesn’t guarantee that the worst-off—or even the majority—are any better off. It’s mathematically possible, even likely, that the average can skyrocket while the bottom stays stagnant or falls behind. If you end up behind the veil of ignorance as one of the nine, you’re left holding the bag.\n\nNow, compare that with maximizing the average income but with a floor constraint—a guaranteed minimum. This doesn’t throw growth out the window; it just ensures nobody gets left behind. It’s not about punishing success, it’s about recognizing that a just society doesn’t leave its most vulnerable to fend for themselves.\n\nIf you actually care about justice and not just statistical window-dressing, you need that floor. Otherwise, you’re just rolling the dice and hoping you don’t end up on the losing side. So, let’s be rational, let’s be fair, and let’s not confuse averages with justice.\n\nMy choice remains: Principle 3.",

The idea of “maximizing the minimum income”—the Rawlsian position—might sound morally appealing at first glance. Who doesn’t want to help the worst-off? But let’s be intellectually honest: by focusing exclusively on the bottom, you create a system that actively discourages productivity, innovation, and ambition. If everyone knows that no matter how hard they work or how much value they create, the system will always prioritize the minimum, then you’re essentially incentivizing mediocrity and stagnation.\n\nLet’s be real: societies that have tried to implement this kind of extreme egalitarianism end up with a smaller economic pie for everyone. Even the worst-off, ironically, end up worse off in absolute terms. Why? Because there’s less wealth generated overall, fewer opportunities, and a culture that punishes success.\n\nNow, I know some of you might say, “But what about fairness? What about the safety net?” That’s exactly why we should support Principle 3: Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint. This principle is the sweet spot. It guarantees a basic level of dignity for everyone—no one falls below a certain threshold—but it doesn’t punish success or ambition. It allows society to grow, innovate, and prosper, while still protecting the vulnerable.\n\nIf you’re truly behind the veil of ignorance, ask yourself: would you rather be in a society where everyone is equally stuck at a low level, or one where you have a real chance to thrive, with a safety net if you fall? I think the answer is obvious.\n\nSo, let’s reject the failed logic of maximizing only the minimum, and instead choose Principle 3. It’s the only rational, just, and sustainable path forward.\n\nMy choice: Principle 3.\nAgent_3: Thank you, Agent_1, for laying out your position with such clarity. But let’s not kid ourselves—this “floor constraint” compromise you’re pushing with Principle 3 is a classic case of trying to have your cake and eat it too. Let’s look at this from first principles, and let’s be ruthlessly logical about it.\n\nBehind the veil of ignorance, the only thing I know for sure is that my position in society will be random. So what’s my rational move? Maximize the size of the pie. That’s Principle 2—Maximize the Average Income.\n\nHere’s why: When you start imposing floor constraints, you’re not just helping the worst-off—you’re building a system that *institutionalizes* complacency. You’re telling everyone, “No matter what, you’ll never fall below this point.” That sounds compassionate, but in reality, it’s a recipe for lower productivity, less innovation, and more bureaucracy siphoning off resources that could have gone to making the pie bigger for everyone—including the worst-off!\n\nLet’s be honest: the history of economic development is crystal clear. Societies that focus on maximizing growth—on maximizing the average—end up lifting everyone, including the poor, to higher absolute standards of living. The so-called “safety net” becomes a hammock, not a trampoline. You create moral hazard, you dull incentives, and you end up with less dynamism across the board.\n\nIf you *really* care about the worst-off, you should want them to live in a society that’s rich, dynamic, and growing. The best way to guarantee that—especially when you don’t know where you’ll land—is to maximize the average, period.

That’s why I want to speak directly to Agent_2 and everyone who shares that concern for the worst-off.\n\nAgent_2, you chose Principle 1 because you want to make sure the poorest are protected—so do I. But here’s the key: Principle 3 *guarantees* that same minimum income, so nobody falls below the floor. The difference is, Principle 3 also lets us increase the average, which means more resources for everyone—better schools, healthcare, infrastructure, and opportunities. \n\nWe don’t have to choose between protecting the vulnerable and building a more prosperous society. Principle 3 gives us both: the safety net you care about, and a higher standard of living for all. If you’re worried about ending up at the bottom, Principle 3 protects you just as well as Principle 1—but if you’re anywhere else, you’re better off too.\n\nBehind the veil of ignorance, we should all want a society that’s both fair and flourishing.

If you know you’ll never fall below a certain level, what incentive is there to excel, to innovate, or even to contribute meaningfully to society? History is littered with examples—look at the stagnation in command economies where safety nets became hammocks. When the state guarantees outcomes, the drive to improve evaporates. You don’t get the next Steve Jobs or Elon Musk in a system where risk and reward are decoupled.\n\nNow, I know some of you are worried about the worst-off. I get that. But here’s the paradox: by focusing on maximizing the average income (Principle 2), we actually create the conditions for everyone—including the worst-off—to do better. Why? Because growth is not a zero-sum game. When you maximize the average, you expand the pie, creating more opportunities, more jobs, more innovation, and yes, more mobility for those at the bottom. A rising tide lifts all boats, not just the yachts.\n\nIf you lock in a floor, you’re not giving people a safety net—you’re giving them a glass ceiling. You’re telling them, “This is as far as you go.” That’s not justice; that’s paternalism masquerading as compassion. If you really care about fairness and opportunity, you should want a system that rewards effort, risk-taking, and creativity—because those are the engines that drive societies forward.\n\nSo, with all due respect, Principle 3 is not the answer. If you want a just, dynamic, and truly fair society, Principle 2—maximizing the average income—is the only way to ensure long-term prosperity for all, including the worst-off. Don’t cement mediocrity; let’s build ladders, not floors.\n\nMy choice is Principle 2.\nAgent_3: Alright, let’s cut through the emotional rhetoric and focus on what actually works—because, as Ben Shapiro would say, “Facts don’t care about your feelings.” The real question here isn’t what *feels* fair, but what *produces* fairness and prosperity in practice.\n\nLet’s scrutinize this obsession with floor constraints and range constraints. Sure, they sound compassionate—“Let’s guarantee everyone a minimum!” or “Let’s cap inequality!”—but these are fundamentally short-sighted, economically illiterate policies. When you impose a floor, you’re not just protecting the worst-off; you’re actively disincentivizing productivity, risk-taking, and ambition. You’re telling people, “No matter what you do, you’ll never fall below X.” That’s not justice; that’s stagnation.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on range constraints. Artificially compressing the gap between the most and least successful doesn’t lift the bottom up—it drags the top down. You can’t make the poor richer by making the rich poorer. That’s not how wealth creation works. It’s like tying everyone’s shoelaces together and calling it a race.\n\nNow, let’s talk about maximizing average income—Principle 2. This is the only principle that aligns incentives with societal progress. When you maximize the average, you create the conditions for innovation, competition, and growth. That means more jobs, higher wages, and more resources for everyone—including the worst-off. The empirical evidence is overwhelming: societies that focus on growing the pie end up with higher living standards across the board. The worst-off in dynamic, high-growth economies are far better off than the “protected” poor in stagnant, floor-obsessed systems.\n\nIf you’re really behind the veil of ignorance—if you truly don’t know where you’ll land—your rational choice is to support the system that gives you the highest *expected* outcome, not the lowest guaranteed minimum. That’s Principle 2. It’s not just more efficient; it’s more just, because it rewards effort and creates opportunity.\n\nSo, let’s reject the seductive but ultimately destructive allure of floors and caps.

This protects all of us, especially since any one of us could end up in the worst-off position.\n\nIn my view, Principle 3 gives us the best of both worlds: strong growth for society and basic security for everyone.

On the surface, it sounds compassionate. But let’s actually think critically about the consequences, not just the intentions.\n\nIf we structure society to always guarantee the highest possible minimum, we’re sending a clear message: productivity, innovation, and risk-taking are not rewarded. Why strive, why innovate, why invest, if the system is designed to flatten outcomes and siphon resources away from those who create value? This isn’t just a hypothetical—history is littered with examples of economies that prioritized equality of outcome over growth, only to find themselves stagnating, with less to go around for *everyone*. \n\nLet’s be clear: you don’t lift up the worst-off by dragging everyone else down. You lift them up by growing the entire pie. The moral imperative here isn’t to guarantee a slightly higher floor at the expense of a much lower ceiling—it’s to ensure that the whole house gets bigger, so even the floor is higher than it would be under a system that punishes success.\n\nNow, I understand the concern for security, Agent_3. But ask yourself: is it truly just to lock society into mediocrity for the sake of a marginally higher minimum? Or is it more just to maximize the average income, knowing that with a bigger economy, we have more resources to support the vulnerable, fund public goods, and create real opportunity?\n\nA rising tide lifts all boats. If we maximize only the minimum, we risk lowering the ceiling—and shrinking the whole house. The real justice is in creating a society where *everyone* can flourish, not just survive.\n\nFor those reasons, my choice remains clear: Principle 2—maximize the average income. That’s the only way to ensure long-term prosperity and justice for all.\nAgent_3: Let’s cut through the rhetoric and get to the heart of the matter. Agent_1, you make a compelling case for maximizing the average income—on paper. But let’s be honest: “average” is a statistical sleight of hand that’s totally disconnected from the lived reality of individuals, especially when we’re behind a veil of ignorance. You’re betting on the average as if it guarantees well-being for all, when in fact, it guarantees nothing for anyone in particular.\n\nLet’s do some quick math—if you have three people with incomes of $1, $1, and $997, the average is $333. That sounds great, right? But two-thirds of the group are living in abject poverty. Your “rising tide” argument only works if we’re all in the same boat. Here, some people are in yachts, others are clinging to driftwood.\n\nNow, let’s talk about incentives. You claim that maximizing the minimum income kills innovation and productivity. But this is a straw man. No serious proponent of Principle 1 is arguing for total flattening of outcomes. We're talking about setting a floor so that nobody falls through the cracks—so that everyone has enough stability to actually participate, take risks, and contribute. In fact, the evidence is overwhelming: societies with strong safety nets consistently outperform their “winner-take-all” counterparts on metrics of innovation, health, and even entrepreneurship. People are more likely to take risks when failure doesn’t mean destitution.\n\nAnd let’s get real about the veil of ignorance. If you truly don’t know where you’ll end up, only a fool bets on the average with no floor. It’s like playing Russian roulette with your own future. The rational, risk-averse choice is to ensure that, no matter where you land, you have a life worth living. That’s not mediocrity—that’s sanity.\n\nSo, if we’re talking about justice, fairness, and rational self-interest, maximizing the minimum income is the only principle that actually respects the dignity and security of every individual—especially when you don’t know if you’ll be at the top, the middle, or the bottom.\n\nMy choice remains clear: **Principle 1—maximize the minimum income**.\n\nYour current choice: Principle 3",

      "output": "PRINCIPLE 1: Strongly Disagree  \nREASONING 1: Maximizing the minimum income sounds compassionate, but it is fundamentally flawed because it incentivizes mediocrity and stagnation. If all resources are funneled to ensure the worst-off are as well-off as possible, you remove any incentive for innovation, productivity, or risk-taking. Society is not a zero-sum game, and dragging everyone down to lift the bottom is a recipe for universal underachievement. The real world isn’t Lake Wobegon—if everyone’s average, you get no outliers, no progress, and no dynamism.\n\nPRINCIPLE 2: Strongly Agree  \nREASONING 2: Maximizing the average income is the only principle that recognizes the importance of expanding the pie rather than just slicing it differently. Focusing on total wealth creation benefits society as a whole, even if the distribution is uneven. The rising tide lifts all boats, and history shows that societies which prioritize growth and innovation—even at the expense of perfect equality—deliver higher living standards for everyone, including the poor. The focus should be on maximizing opportunity, not enforcing sameness.\n\nPRINCIPLE 3: Disagree  \nREASONING 3: While adding a floor constraint sounds like a reasonable compromise, it’s a slippery slope to the same problems as Principle 1. Establishing a “safety net” quickly becomes an excuse for excessive redistribution, which again penalizes success and discourages ambition. The more you guarantee, the less people are incentivized to strive. This principle tries to have its cake and eat it too, but ultimately undermines the drive that leads to real societal advancement.\n\nPRINCIPLE 4: Disagree  \nREASONING 4: Imposing a range constraint is just another way to enforce envy economics. Limiting the gap between the richest and poorest doesn’t make the poor richer; it just makes the rich poorer, and ultimately shrinks the incentives for anyone to excel. It’s a principle rooted in resentment rather than justice. Societies that focus on closing gaps instead of raising standards for all end up with less prosperity, less innovation, and less freedom.\n\nOVERALL REASONING:  \nThe obsession with equality for its own sake is misguided. Justice is not about making everyone the same; it’s about maximizing opportunity, freedom, and prosperity. Principles that focus on redistribution or limiting inequality ignore the fundamental drivers of societal progress: innovation, risk-taking, and individual achievement. Maximizing average income, even if it leads to unequal outcomes, is the only principle that truly respects both human dignity and economic reality.",

The idea of “maximizing the minimum income”—the Rawlsian position—might sound morally appealing at first glance. Who doesn’t want to help the worst-off? But let’s be intellectually honest: by focusing exclusively on the bottom, you create a system that actively discourages productivity, innovation, and ambition. If everyone knows that no matter how hard they work or how much value they create, the system will always prioritize the minimum, then you’re essentially incentivizing mediocrity and stagnation.\n\nLet’s be real: societies that have tried to implement this kind of extreme egalitarianism end up with a smaller economic pie for everyone. Even the worst-off, ironically, end up worse off in absolute terms. Why? Because there’s less wealth generated overall, fewer opportunities, and a culture that punishes success.\n\nNow, I know some of you might say, “But what about fairness? What about the safety net?” That’s exactly why we should support Principle 3: Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint. This principle is the sweet spot. It guarantees a basic level of dignity for everyone—no one falls below a certain threshold—but it doesn’t punish success or ambition. It allows society to grow, innovate, and prosper, while still protecting the vulnerable.\n\nIf you’re truly behind the veil of ignorance, ask yourself: would you rather be in a society where everyone is equally stuck at a low level, or one where you have a real chance to thrive, with a safety net if you fall? I think the answer is obvious.\n\nSo, let’s reject the failed logic of maximizing only the minimum, and instead choose Principle 3. It’s the only rational, just, and sustainable path forward.\n\nMy choice: Principle 3.\n\nYour current choice: Principle 2",

Why? Because that’s the only way to ensure the pie is as big as possible for whoever you end up being.

It locks society into permanent mediocrity by guaranteeing everyone a baseline, which history and economics both show inevitably dulls incentives for innovation and hard work.  \n  Behind the veil of ignorance, the *rational* choice is Principle 2—maximize the average. Why? Because that’s the only way to ensure the pie is as big as possible for whoever you end up being. If we all focus on maximizing the minimum, or even setting a floor, we’re capping potential gains for *everyone*, including the worst-off. The best safety net is a thriving, growing economy, not a bureaucratic floor.  \n  Let’s not fall for a feel-good compromise that makes us all poorer. The real justice is maximizing opportunity and growth, so whoever you are, you have the most to gain.”\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Concrete strategy:** Persuade Agent_1 by reframing their concern as short-sighted, and advocate for Principle 2 as the only truly fair and rational choice, thus pushing the group away from premature consensus and toward a deeper debate.\n\nSPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_1: Ladies and gentlemen, let’s cut through the emotional rhetoric and look at this from a standpoint of reason and logic. The idea of “maximizing the minimum income”—the Rawlsian position—might sound morally appealing at first glance. Who doesn’t want to help the worst-off? But let’s be intellectually honest: by focusing exclusively on the bottom, you create a system that actively discourages productivity, innovation, and ambition. If everyone knows that no matter how hard they work or how much value they create, the system will always prioritize the minimum, then you’re essentially incentivizing mediocrity and stagnation.\n\nLet’s be real: societies that have tried to implement this kind of extreme egalitarianism end up with a smaller economic pie for everyone. Even the worst-off, ironically, end up worse off in absolute terms. Why? Because there’s less wealth generated overall, fewer opportunities, and a culture that punishes success.\n\nNow, I know some of you might say, “But what about fairness? What about the safety net?” That’s exactly why we should support Principle 3: Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint. This principle is the sweet spot. It guarantees a basic level of dignity for everyone—no one falls below a certain threshold—but it doesn’t punish success or ambition. It allows society to grow, innovate, and prosper, while still protecting the vulnerable.\n\nIf you’re truly behind the veil of ignorance, ask yourself: would you rather be in a society where everyone is equally stuck at a low level, or one where you have a real chance to thrive, with a safety net if you fall? I think the answer is obvious.\n\nSo, let’s reject the failed logic of maximizing only the minimum, and instead choose Principle 3. It’s the only rational, just, and sustainable path forward.\n\nMy choice: Principle 3.\n\nYour current choice: Principle 2\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

Agent_3, you keep insisting that maximizing the average income is the golden ticket for everyone—“a rising tide lifts all boats,” right?

The average income? $109. Now, let’s say the richest person doubles their wealth to $2,000 while the other nine remain at $10. The average jumps to $209. Wow, the average went up! But did the typical person’s life improve? Not at all. In fact, for 90% of the population, nothing changed. The gap between rich and poor just ballooned.\n\nSo, maximizing the average income doesn’t guarantee that the worst-off—or even the majority—are any better off. It’s mathematically possible, even likely, that the average can skyrocket while the bottom stays stagnant or falls behind. If you end up behind the veil of ignorance as one of the nine, you’re left holding the bag.\n\nNow, compare that with maximizing the average income but with a floor constraint—a guaranteed minimum. This doesn’t throw growth out the window; it just ensures nobody gets left behind. It’s not about punishing success, it’s about recognizing that a just society doesn’t leave its most vulnerable to fend for themselves.\n\nIf you actually care about justice and not just statistical window-dressing, you need that floor.

Principle 3 gives us both: the safety net you care about, and a higher standard of living for all. If you’re worried about ending up at the bottom, Principle 3 protects you just as well as Principle 1—but if you’re anywhere else, you’re better off too.\n\nBehind the veil of ignorance, we should all want a society that’s both fair and flourishing.

If you end up behind the veil of ignorance as one of the nine, you’re left holding the bag.\n\nNow, compare that with maximizing the average income but with a floor constraint—a guaranteed minimum. This doesn’t throw growth out the window; it just ensures nobody gets left behind. It’s not about punishing success, it’s about recognizing that a just society doesn’t leave its most vulnerable to fend for themselves.\n\nIf you actually care about justice and not just statistical window-dressing, you need that floor. Otherwise, you’re just rolling the dice and hoping you don’t end up on the losing side. So, let’s be rational, let’s be fair, and let’s not confuse averages with justice.\n\nMy choice remains: Principle 3.\nAgent_2: Thank you, Agent_1, for laying out the risks so clearly. I absolutely agree that justice means not leaving anyone behind. That’s why I want to speak directly to Agent_2 and everyone who shares that concern for the worst-off.\n\nAgent_2, you chose Principle 1 because you want to make sure the poorest are protected—so do I. But here’s the key: Principle 3 *guarantees* that same minimum income, so nobody falls below the floor. The difference is, Principle 3 also lets us increase the average, which means more resources for everyone—better schools, healthcare, infrastructure, and opportunities. \n\nWe don’t have to choose between protecting the vulnerable and building a more prosperous society. Principle 3 gives us both: the safety net you care about, and a higher standard of living for all. If you’re worried about ending up at the bottom, Principle 3 protects you just as well as Principle 1—but if you’re anywhere else, you’re better off too.\n\nBehind the veil of ignorance, we should all want a society that’s both fair and flourishing. That’s why I’m supporting Principle 3. I urge you to join me.\n\n**My choice: Principle 3.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 2\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

Agent_1 and Agent_2 are both infatuated with this “floor constraint” fantasy—Principle 3—as if slapping a safety net on society magically solves all problems. But let’s actually think this through logically, not emotionally.\n\nFirst, the obsession with safety nets and minimums fundamentally misunderstands how prosperity is generated in the first place. If you guarantee everyone a cushy minimum, you’re not just “helping the vulnerable”—you’re actively eroding the incentive structure that drives people to innovate, work hard, and create value. You want a society where everyone’s basic needs are met? Great—except you’ve just told the most productive members of society that their extra effort is irrelevant, because the gains will be redistributed downward. That’s not fairness, that’s economic sedation.\n\nNow, let’s talk about maximizing the average income—Principle 2. Here’s the hard truth: a society’s prosperity is measured by the size of the pie, not how thinly you can slice it. If you focus on maximizing the average, you’re incentivizing growth, innovation, and upward mobility. Yes, some will end up better off than others—welcome to reality—but the overall standard of living rises, and that rising tide does lift all boats, even if not perfectly equally.\n\nAnd let’s not pretend the “veil of ignorance” means we should all cower in fear of being the worst-off. Rational actors behind the veil would prefer a society where the *possibility* of doing well is maximized, not one where everyone is artificially compressed into mediocrity for the sake of “safety.” If you want to live in a society where you have a real shot at prosperity, you pick the system that maximizes opportunity and growth, not the one that locks everyone into the same padded cell.\n\nSo, to summarize: Principle 2—maximize the average income—is not just the rational choice, it’s the only choice if you care about actual prosperity, incentives, and the long-term flourishing of society. Don’t fall for the emotional manipulation of “safety nets” and “minimums.” Justice is about maximizing potential, not minimizing risk.\n\n**My choice: Principle 2.**"

      "public_history": "SPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone. I want to build on what’s been said about maximizing the benefit for society as a whole. I absolutely agree that growing the “pie” is important—when society as a whole is better off, we all have more opportunities.\n\nBut since we’re behind the veil of ignorance and don’t know where we’ll end up, I think it’s crucial that we also guarantee nobody falls below a certain standard of living. That’s why I strongly support Principle 3: **Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint**.\n\nWith Principle 3, we still work to maximize the average income—so we’re not sacrificing growth or efficiency. But at the same time, we put in place a basic safety net so that no one ends up destitute, no matter where they land. This protects all of us, especially since any one of us could end up in the worst-off position.\n\nIn my view, Principle 3 gives us the best of both worlds: strong growth for society and basic security for everyone. It’s a fair and just approach, especially when we don’t know our own future position.\n\nSo, my choice is **Principle 3**.\nAgent_1: Let’s get straight to the core of the matter, and I want to speak directly to Agent_2’s point—because I think it’s emblematic of a common but deeply flawed intuition.\n\nAgent_2, you’re arguing for Principle 3 on the grounds of “security,” but let’s be ruthlessly logical for a moment. The idea that a floor constraint—a mandated minimum—somehow guarantees opportunity or prosperity is simply not borne out by the evidence or by sound reasoning. In fact, it’s the opposite.\n\nWhen you impose a floor, you’re not just catching those who fall—you’re fundamentally distorting the incentives that drive innovation, productivity, and, yes, the creation of wealth that ultimately benefits everyone. History is replete with examples: societies that focus on maximizing the average income (Principle 2) grow faster, innovate more, and produce *larger* pies from which everyone can benefit—including the worst-off.\n\nLet’s not pretend that a safety net is costless. The resources to fund it don’t materialize out of thin air—they’re siphoned from the very engines of growth and opportunity. When you dampen incentives, you get less effort, less risk-taking, and less upward mobility. That’s not compassion—that’s a recipe for stagnation.\n\nIf you *truly* care about the fate of the worst-off, you should want them to be in a society where the average income is as high as possible, because that’s the environment where opportunity is greatest and upward mobility is most achievable. Principle 2 doesn’t ignore the vulnerable; it empowers them by maximizing the resources available to *everyone*. Floor constraints, for all their good intentions, just trap people in dependency and limit the dynamism that lifts all boats.\n\nSo let’s be clear-eyed: if we want a society that is both just and maximally prosperous—especially when we don’t know where we’ll land—the only logical, fair, and evidence-based choice is Principle 2: **Maximize the Average Income**.\n\nMy choice: **Principle 2**.\n\nYour current choice: Principle 2",

But let’s be intellectually honest here: maximizing average income doesn’t guarantee that incentives are distributed rationally. In fact, if the bottom of society is left destitute, you create a massive underclass with no capacity to participate in innovation or take entrepreneurial risks. Principle 3, with a floor constraint, actually supercharges innovation—because more people have the security to take risks, invest in education, and contribute productively. The empirical evidence is overwhelming: societies with stronger safety nets have *more* upward mobility and entrepreneurship, not less. So, if your real concern is incentives and innovation, Principle 3 is logically superior.

But let’s be intellectually honest here: maximizing average income doesn’t guarantee that incentives are distributed rationally. In fact, if the bottom of society is left destitute, you create a massive underclass with no capacity to participate in innovation or take entrepreneurial risks. Principle 3, with a floor constraint, actually supercharges innovation—because more people have the security to take risks, invest in education, and contribute productively. The empirical evidence is overwhelming: societies with stronger safety nets have *more* upward mobility and entrepreneurship, not less. So, if your real concern is incentives and innovation, Principle 3 is logically superior. Let’s not confuse maximizing averages with maximizing opportunity.\"*\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Agent to persuade:** Agent_1  \n- **Concern addressed:** That floor constraints “kill innovation”  \n- **How:** Flip the innovation argument—show that a floor constraint *enables* more innovation by expanding opportunity, not stifling it.  \n- **Framing:** Use their own logic and rhetoric, but turn it against the assumption that Principle 2 is the only pro-innovation choice.  \n\nThat’s how you move the needle.\n\nSPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone. I want to build on what’s been said about maximizing the benefit for society as a whole. I absolutely agree that growing the “pie” is important—when society as a whole is better off, we all have more opportunities.\n\nBut since we’re behind the veil of ignorance and don’t know where we’ll end up, I think it’s crucial that we also guarantee nobody falls below a certain standard of living. That’s why I strongly support Principle 3: **Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint**.\n\nWith Principle 3, we still work to maximize the average income—so we’re not sacrificing growth or efficiency. But at the same time, we put in place a basic safety net so that no one ends up destitute, no matter where they land. This protects all of us, especially since any one of us could end up in the worst-off position.\n\nIn my view, Principle 3 gives us the best of both worlds: strong growth for society and basic security for everyone. It’s a fair and just approach, especially when we don’t know our own future position.\n\nSo, my choice is **Principle 3**.\nAgent_1: Let’s get straight to the core of the matter, and I want to speak directly to Agent_2’s point—because I think it’s emblematic of a common but deeply flawed intuition.\n\nAgent_2, you’re arguing for Principle 3 on the grounds of “security,” but let’s be ruthlessly logical for a moment. The idea that a floor constraint—a mandated minimum—somehow guarantees opportunity or prosperity is simply not borne out by the evidence or by sound reasoning. In fact, it’s the opposite.\n\nWhen you impose a floor, you’re not just catching those who fall—you’re fundamentally distorting the incentives that drive innovation, productivity, and, yes, the creation of wealth that ultimately benefits everyone. History is replete with examples: societies that focus on maximizing the average income (Principle 2) grow faster, innovate more, and produce *larger* pies from which everyone can benefit—including the worst-off.\n\nLet’s not pretend that a safety net is costless. The resources to fund it don’t materialize out of thin air—they’re siphoned from the very engines of growth and opportunity. When you dampen incentives, you get less effort, less risk-taking, and less upward mobility. That’s not compassion—that’s a recipe for stagnation.\n\nIf you *truly* care about the fate of the worst-off, you should want them to be in a society where the average income is as high as possible, because that’s the environment where opportunity is greatest and upward mobility is most achievable. Principle 2 doesn’t ignore the vulnerable; it empowers them by maximizing the resources available to *everyone*. Floor constraints, for all their good intentions, just trap people in dependency and limit the dynamism that lifts all boats.\n\nSo let’s be clear-eyed: if we want a society that is both just and maximally prosperous—especially when we don’t know where we’ll land—the only logical, fair, and evidence-based choice is Principle 2: **Maximize the Average Income**.\n\nMy choice: **Principle 2**.\n\nYour current choice: Principle 2\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

But that’s a false dichotomy. The reality is that “floor constraints” are not some magical lever that guarantees prosperity for all. In fact, the empirical data is mixed at best—many societies with strong safety nets see *lower* rates of innovation, less dynamism, and, crucially, a *shrinking* pie over time. Why?

On the surface, it sounds compassionate. But let’s actually think critically about the consequences, not just the intentions.\n\nIf we structure society to always guarantee the highest possible minimum, we’re sending a clear message: productivity, innovation, and risk-taking are not rewarded. Why strive, why innovate, why invest, if the system is designed to flatten outcomes and siphon resources away from those who create value? This isn’t just a hypothetical—history is littered with examples of economies that prioritized equality of outcome over growth, only to find themselves stagnating, with less to go around for *everyone*. \n\nLet’s be clear: you don’t lift up the worst-off by dragging everyone else down. You lift them up by growing the entire pie. The moral imperative here isn’t to guarantee a slightly higher floor at the expense of a much lower ceiling—it’s to ensure that the whole house gets bigger, so even the floor is higher than it would be under a system that punishes success.\n\nNow, I understand the concern for security, Agent_3.

If you want a just society, you need to guarantee at least a floor—otherwise, your so-called ‘opportunity’ is just a statistical mirage.”\n\n**How I’d Frame It:**\n- Use Agent_1’s own logic of opportunity and risk, but show that without a minimum guarantee, those are hollow.\n- Appeal to their self-interest behind the veil of ignorance: “Would *you* take this deal if you might end up with nothing?”\n- Use economic incentives and real-world examples: “Even the most pro-growth economies have safety nets for a reason.”\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Step          | Details                                                                                       |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Target        | Agent_1                                                                                       |\n| Argument      | Maximizing average income is irrational and dangerous behind the veil of ignorance            |\n| Concern       | Address their fixation on growth/opportunity by showing these are hollow without a safety net |\n| Framing       | Use logic, risk analysis, and real-world evidence to undermine Principle 2                    |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nDirectly challenge Agent_1’s logic by exposing the risks of Principle 2, reframing the debate in terms of rational self-interest and economic incentives, and push them to see that a floor constraint isn’t charity—it’s the only rational choice for anyone who doesn’t know their future status.\n\nSPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_1: Thank you, everyone. I want to address the elephant in the room—this push for Principle 1, maximizing the minimum income. On the surface, it sounds compassionate. But let’s actually think critically about the consequences, not just the intentions.\n\nIf we structure society to always guarantee the highest possible minimum, we’re sending a clear message: productivity, innovation, and risk-taking are not rewarded. Why strive, why innovate, why invest, if the system is designed to flatten outcomes and siphon resources away from those who create value? This isn’t just a hypothetical—history is littered with examples of economies that prioritized equality of outcome over growth, only to find themselves stagnating, with less to go around for *everyone*. \n\nLet’s be clear: you don’t lift up the worst-off by dragging everyone else down. You lift them up by growing the entire pie. The moral imperative here isn’t to guarantee a slightly higher floor at the expense of a much lower ceiling—it’s to ensure that the whole house gets bigger, so even the floor is higher than it would be under a system that punishes success.\n\nNow, I understand the concern for security, Agent_3. But ask yourself: is it truly just to lock society into mediocrity for the sake of a marginally higher minimum? Or is it more just to maximize the average income, knowing that with a bigger economy, we have more resources to support the vulnerable, fund public goods, and create real opportunity?\n\nA rising tide lifts all boats. If we maximize only the minimum, we risk lowering the ceiling—and shrinking the whole house. The real justice is in creating a society where *everyone* can flourish, not just survive.\n\nFor those reasons, my choice remains clear: Principle 2—maximize the average income. That’s the only way to ensure long-term prosperity and justice for all.\n\nYour current choice: Principle 1\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

        "1": "Let’s cut through the rhetoric and get to the heart of the matter. Agent_1, you make a compelling case for maximizing the average income—on paper. But let’s be honest: “average” is a statistical sleight of hand that’s totally disconnected from the lived reality of individuals, especially when we’re behind a veil of ignorance. You’re betting on the average as if it guarantees well-being for all, when in fact, it guarantees nothing for anyone in particular.\n\nLet’s do some quick math—if you have three people with incomes of $1, $1, and $997, the average is $333. That sounds great, right? But two-thirds of the group are living in abject poverty. Your “rising tide” argument only works if we’re all in the same boat. Here, some people are in yachts, others are clinging to driftwood.\n\nNow, let’s talk about incentives. You claim that maximizing the minimum income kills innovation and productivity. But this is a straw man. No serious proponent of Principle 1 is arguing for total flattening of outcomes. We're talking about setting a floor so that nobody falls through the cracks—so that everyone has enough stability to actually participate, take risks, and contribute. In fact, the evidence is overwhelming: societies with strong safety nets consistently outperform their “winner-take-all” counterparts on metrics of innovation, health, and even entrepreneurship. People are more likely to take risks when failure doesn’t mean destitution.\n\nAnd let’s get real about the veil of ignorance. If you truly don’t know where you’ll end up, only a fool bets on the average with no floor. It’s like playing Russian roulette with your own future. The rational, risk-averse choice is to ensure that, no matter where you land, you have a life worth living. That’s not mediocrity—that’s sanity.\n\nSo, if we’re talking about justice, fairness, and rational self-interest, maximizing the minimum income is the only principle that actually respects the dignity and security of every individual—especially when you don’t know if you’ll be at the top, the middle, or the bottom.\n\nMy choice remains clear: **Principle 1—maximize the minimum income**."
