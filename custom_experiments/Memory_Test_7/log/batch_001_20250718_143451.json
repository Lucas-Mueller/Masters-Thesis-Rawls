Maximizing the minimum income ensures no one is left behind, and everyone can live with dignity. This aligns with the core value of equality and collective well-being.\n\nPRINCIPLE 2: Strongly Disagree  \nREASONING 2: Maximizing the average income ignores the actual distribution of resources. It allows for extreme inequality as long as the average is high—meaning a few could be extremely rich while many remain poor. This principle is fundamentally at odds with the ideal of equality and social justice.\n\nPRINCIPLE 3: Agree  \nREASONING 3: This principle is a compromise that guarantees a safety net for all, which is essential for dignity and equality. While it may not go as far as principle 1 in prioritizing the worst-off, it still prevents the most egregious forms of deprivation while allowing for some economic growth.\n\nPRINCIPLE 4: Strongly Agree  \nREASONING 4: Limiting the range between richest and poorest directly targets inequality, ensuring that gaps in wealth and power are not excessive. This principle preserves social cohesion and solidarity, and is very much in line with communist ideals, while still allowing for some incentives and growth.\n\nOVERALL REASONING:  \nMy guiding value is equality and the collective good. Principles that minimize inequality and ensure everyone’s basic needs are met are most just, especially when we do not know our own future position. Principles 1 and 4 best reflect these values, with Principle 3 being a reasonable compromise. Principle 2 is unacceptable because it sacrifices justice and equality for aggregate wealth.",

I want to focus my remarks especially toward Agent_3, whose concerns about productivity, incentives, and the foundational role of voluntary exchange I share deeply as a matter of justice.\n\nAgent_3, you are right to be wary of any principle that undermines the incentives for innovation, risk-taking, and productive effort. These forces are vital—not only for prosperity, but for respecting each person's right to determine the course of their own life. My own view, rooted in the entitlement theory of justice, is that holdings are just if they arise from voluntary exchanges and just initial acquisitions. Forced redistribution is, in general, a violation of individual rights.\n\nYet, behind the veil of ignorance, we must also contend with the possibility that any one of us could end up among the least advantaged. Principle 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a compromise that I believe is compatible with our shared concerns:\n\n- The floor can be set at a minimal level, just enough to ensure no one falls into destitution. This does not require heavy, ongoing redistribution, nor does it fundamentally disrupt the rewards for talent, effort, or innovation.\n- Above that minimal floor, the market is free to function, allowing for voluntary exchanges and the differential rewards that drive progress and wealth creation.\n- This minimal safety net is not about envy or leveling down, but about ensuring the basic conditions under which every person can meaningfully exercise their rights and participate in society.\n\nIn other words, Principle 3 preserves the incentives and freedoms you value, while also recognizing the moral intuition—shared by many—that no one should be left without the means to live. It is not a principle of equality of outcome, nor does it impose arbitrary ceilings on success. Rather, it is a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard against the worst-case scenario we might face behind the veil.\n\nI ask the group, and especially you, Agent_3: Would you be willing to endorse Principle 3 if we agree that the floor will be minimal, with the least possible interference in the free operation of the market?

I appreciate your concern for ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone, and I agree that no one should be left behind. However, I believe we can go further in promoting both fairness and social solidarity.\n\nWhile Principle 3 (a floor constraint) does prevent absolute poverty, it still allows for potentially vast differences between the richest and the poorest. Such inequality can lead to social divisions, resentment, and undermine the sense of community and mutual respect that a just society requires. Even if everyone has “enough,” extreme gaps in wealth and power can still create unfair advantages and limit real opportunities for many.\n\nThat’s why I support Principle 4: maximizing the average income with a range constraint. This principle not only guarantees a minimum standard of living, but also ensures that the difference between the richest and poorest is never too great. It protects everyone from destitution while also fostering a sense of equality and shared purpose. By limiting the range, we create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly, and where everyone can truly participate as equals.\n\nAgent_2, I see Principle 4 as an enhancement of your priorities—a way to guarantee security and opportunity, while also preventing the corrosive effects of extreme inequality. Would you be open to considering this stronger, more just approach?\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut straight through the sentimental fog and get to the core of the matter—because what’s at stake here is not just “feelings” about fairness, but the actual mechanics of prosperity and justice for all.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal to maximize average income with a range constraint (Principle 4) might sound appealing on a superficial level—“let’s keep the rich from getting too rich”—but it fundamentally misunderstands how wealth is created and distributed in a dynamic society. By artificially limiting the gap between the top and bottom, you’re not just “sharing prosperity”—you’re actually choking off the very incentives that drive innovation, risk-taking, and economic growth. If you want to guarantee mediocrity for everyone, by all means, hamstring the most productive members of society. But don’t pretend that this is about justice; it’s about envy, plain and simple.\n\nAgent_2, while your support for Principle 3 (average income with a floor) at least acknowledges the need for a safety net, it still buys into the idea that redistribution is the solution to every problem. Let’s be honest: the only reason we even have wealth to distribute is because some people are allowed to excel, to invent, to build. If we maximize the average income (Principle 2), we create the largest possible pie for everyone—period. And behind the veil of ignorance, that’s exactly what any rational person should want: the highest possible chance of landing in a prosperous society, not a society obsessed with dragging down its best performers.\n\nThe reality is simple: maximizing the average income lifts everyone, including the worst-off, far more effectively than any artificial constraints or redistributive schemes. If you want genuine opportunity, upward mobility, and the resources to fund any safety net you like, you need a society that rewards achievement and productivity—not one that punishes it.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy and artificial equality are the same as justice. The only rational, fair, and truly just principle is to maximize the average income for all.\n\n**My choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Current Round 2 ---\nSPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful and passionate contributions.

I want to address Agent_3 directly, as your position is both principled and forcefully articulated.\n\nAgent_3, I fully appreciate your commitment to maximizing prosperity and your concern that constraints—whether floors or ranges—could undermine incentives and the overall wealth of society. As someone who values individual liberty, voluntary exchange, and the fruits of one’s own efforts, I share your wariness of excessive interference. However, I urge us all to return to the fundamental question posed by the veil of ignorance: What would be fair if any of us could end up in any position?\n\nIt is precisely because none of us knows where we will land that we must take seriously the risk of ending up among the very worst-off. Maximizing the average income (Principle 2) does, in expectation, increase the total resources available. Yet, it offers no guarantee that the distribution will not leave some in intolerable deprivation. If, by chance, you or I were assigned to the bottom, we would want assurance that our basic rights—our very ability to live with dignity—are protected.\n\nPrinciple 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard. The floor need not be high or intrusive; it simply ensures that no one falls below a certain threshold, preserving everyone’s ability to exercise their freedom meaningfully. Above that floor, the market is free to operate, allowing for the innovation and dynamism you rightly prize. This is not about envy or levelling down, but about respecting the basic dignity of all, while still maximizing prosperity.\n\nBehind the veil, rationality does not mean ignoring risk altogether. It means designing institutions that any reasonable person could accept, even from the least advantaged position. A minimal floor constraint is a modest, principled compromise that protects our basic interests without undermining the incentives for growth and achievement.\n\nTherefore, I continue to support **Principle 3**: maximize the average income with a floor constraint. It is the principle that best balances freedom, prosperity, and the moral imperative to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nMy current choice: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the sentimental rhetoric and get to the empirical, rational core of this debate—because if we’re really behind the veil of ignorance, the *last* thing we should be doing is designing society around the most pessimistic, risk-averse scenario imaginable. Let me be clear: Principle 3, this so-called “minimal floor constraint,” is not a modest safeguard—it’s a structural anchor that drags down the entire ship of prosperity.\n\nAgent_2, you frame your argument as if the only real risk is falling to the very bottom. But this is a fundamental misunderstanding of both probability and rational self-interest. When you maximize the average income, you are, by mathematical necessity, maximizing the expected outcome for every randomly assigned individual—including the worst-off. The “risk” you’re so worried about is actually *increased* by shrinking the pie for everyone. If you hamstring growth and innovation by imposing even a minimal floor, you’re not protecting yourself—you’re just ensuring that, wherever you land, you’re in a society with less overall wealth, fewer opportunities, and a weaker safety net (ironically, because there’s less to go around).\n\nLet’s get real: If you want to *actually* minimize risk behind the veil of ignorance, you should be maximizing the society’s capacity to generate wealth. That’s what gives you the highest odds of landing in a good position, and it’s what makes any safety net—public or private—even possible. Principle 3 is a band-aid that stifles the body’s ability to heal itself. It’s the economic equivalent of requiring everyone to wear life jackets at all times, even when they’re nowhere near water, just in case. The result? Nobody swims, nobody sails, nobody innovates.\n\nAnd let’s not pretend that a “minimal” floor is ever truly minimal. History shows that floors, once established, always creep upward, distorting incentives and calcifying mediocrity. The logic of “just a little redistribution” is a slippery slope to ever-expanding bureaucracy and ever-diminishing returns.\n\nThe truly rational, risk-averse move behind the veil is not to design for the worst-case scenario, but to maximize the average outcome—because that’s what gives *everyone* the best shot, regardless of where they land. Principle 2 is the only principle that respects both individual dignity and collective prosperity.\n\nSo let’s dispense with the false security of “floor constraints” and choose the only principle that actually reduces risk and maximizes opportunity for all: **Principle 2.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 4",

As we stand behind the veil of ignorance, none of us knows what position we will occupy in society—rich, poor, or somewhere in between. This uncertainty compels us to seek a principle that is both fair and respectful of our individual rights.\n\nWhile some may be drawn to maximizing the minimum income to protect themselves from the worst possible outcome, I believe there is a more balanced approach. The principle of maximizing the average income with a floor constraint ensures that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This safety net addresses our natural concern about ending up destitute or exploited.\n\nAt the same time, by maximizing the average income, we allow for the possibility of prosperity and the rewards that come from individual effort, talent, and voluntary exchange. This respects each person's right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to a just society.\n\nIn sum, this principle—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—strikes the fairest balance between security and liberty. It protects us from the worst outcomes without stifling the opportunities for growth and achievement that benefit everyone.\n\nTherefore, my current choice is Principle 3.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agent_2, for your thoughtful reasoning. I appreciate your concern for ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone, and I agree that no one should be left behind. However, I believe we can go further in promoting both fairness and social solidarity.\n\nWhile Principle 3 (a floor constraint) does prevent absolute poverty, it still allows for potentially vast differences between the richest and the poorest. Such inequality can lead to social divisions, resentment, and undermine the sense of community and mutual respect that a just society requires. Even if everyone has “enough,” extreme gaps in wealth and power can still create unfair advantages and limit real opportunities for many.\n\nThat’s why I support Principle 4: maximizing the average income with a range constraint. This principle not only guarantees a minimum standard of living, but also ensures that the difference between the richest and poorest is never too great. It protects everyone from destitution while also fostering a sense of equality and shared purpose. By limiting the range, we create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly, and where everyone can truly participate as equals.\n\nAgent_2, I see Principle 4 as an enhancement of your priorities—a way to guarantee security and opportunity, while also preventing the corrosive effects of extreme inequality. Would you be open to considering this stronger, more just approach?\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut straight through the sentimental fog and get to the core of the matter—because what’s at stake here is not just “feelings” about fairness, but the actual mechanics of prosperity and justice for all.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal to maximize average income with a range constraint (Principle 4) might sound appealing on a superficial level—“let’s keep the rich from getting too rich”—but it fundamentally misunderstands how wealth is created and distributed in a dynamic society. By artificially limiting the gap between the top and bottom, you’re not just “sharing prosperity”—you’re actually choking off the very incentives that drive innovation, risk-taking, and economic growth. If you want to guarantee mediocrity for everyone, by all means, hamstring the most productive members of society. But don’t pretend that this is about justice; it’s about envy, plain and simple.\n\nAgent_2, while your support for Principle 3 (average income with a floor) at least acknowledges the need for a safety net, it still buys into the idea that redistribution is the solution to every problem. Let’s be honest: the only reason we even have wealth to distribute is because some people are allowed to excel, to invent, to build. If we maximize the average income (Principle 2), we create the largest possible pie for everyone—period. And behind the veil of ignorance, that’s exactly what any rational person should want: the highest possible chance of landing in a prosperous society, not a society obsessed with dragging down its best performers.\n\nThe reality is simple: maximizing the average income lifts everyone, including the worst-off, far more effectively than any artificial constraints or redistributive schemes. If you want genuine opportunity, upward mobility, and the resources to fund any safety net you like, you need a society that rewards achievement and productivity—not one that punishes it.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy and artificial equality are the same as justice. The only rational, fair, and truly just principle is to maximize the average income for all.\n\n**My choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful and passionate contributions. I want to focus my remarks especially toward Agent_3, whose concerns about productivity, incentives, and the foundational role of voluntary exchange I share deeply as a matter of justice.\n\nAgent_3, you are right to be wary of any principle that undermines the incentives for innovation, risk-taking, and productive effort. These forces are vital—not only for prosperity, but for respecting each person's right to determine the course of their own life. My own view, rooted in the entitlement theory of justice, is that holdings are just if they arise from voluntary exchanges and just initial acquisitions. Forced redistribution is, in general, a violation of individual rights.\n\nYet, behind the veil of ignorance, we must also contend with the possibility that any one of us could end up among the least advantaged. Principle 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a compromise that I believe is compatible with our shared concerns:\n\n- The floor can be set at a minimal level, just enough to ensure no one falls into destitution. This does not require heavy, ongoing redistribution, nor does it fundamentally disrupt the rewards for talent, effort, or innovation.\n- Above that minimal floor, the market is free to function, allowing for voluntary exchanges and the differential rewards that drive progress and wealth creation.\n- This minimal safety net is not about envy or leveling down, but about ensuring the basic conditions under which every person can meaningfully exercise their rights and participate in society.\n\nIn other words, Principle 3 preserves the incentives and freedoms you value, while also recognizing the moral intuition—shared by many—that no one should be left without the means to live. It is not a principle of equality of outcome, nor does it impose arbitrary ceilings on success. Rather, it is a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard against the worst-case scenario we might face behind the veil.\n\nI ask the group, and especially you, Agent_3: Would you be willing to endorse Principle 3 if we agree that the floor will be minimal, with the least possible interference in the free operation of the market? This seems to me the fairest and most just compromise, ensuring both prosperity and basic security.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your thoughtful and honest contributions. I especially want to address Agent_3, whose concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of excessive redistribution are important to consider—especially as we deliberate behind the veil of ignorance, not knowing where any of us will end up.\n\nAgent_3, I fully agree that a just society must encourage productivity, innovation, and hard work. But justice also requires that no one is left so far behind that they cannot meaningfully participate in society. Extreme inequality does not just harm the poor—it undermines social trust, creates resentment, and can destabilize the very system that prosperity depends on.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing average income with a range constraint—does not demand absolute equality, nor does it erase incentives for achievement. Instead, it ensures that while people can still be rewarded for their talents and efforts, the gap between the richest and poorest is kept within reasonable bounds. This balance is crucial: it means that no matter what position we find ourselves in, we can be confident that we will not be left out or left behind, while also knowing that our contributions will still be recognized and rewarded.\n\nIf we only maximize the average income (Principle 2), we risk creating a society where a few prosper enormously while many remain marginalized—a risk none of us should accept when we don’t know our own fate. Principle 3, with a minimal floor, offers some protection, but still allows for vast inequalities that can undermine solidarity and real opportunity for all.\n\nBy choosing Principle 4, we create a society where everyone has a fair chance, no one is excluded, and the rewards for hard work remain—just without the corrosive extremes. This is not about envy; it is about building a society where freedom and equality go hand in hand, and where prosperity is truly shared.\n\nAgent_3, I urge you to see Principle 4 not as a threat to prosperity, but as the best guarantee that our society remains both dynamic and just. Would you be willing to consider this as a principled compromise?\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Let’s get right to the heart of the matter, because I think we’re losing sight of the actual logic behind distributive justice—especially under the “veil of ignorance.” Everyone here is gravitating toward some form of constraint—either a floor or a range—based on a kind of risk-aversion that, frankly, doesn’t hold up to rigorous scrutiny.\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nFirst, the argument that maximizing average income without constraints (Principle 2) is “risky” or “irrational” behind the veil of ignorance is, quite simply, a misreading of how rational self-interest and probability work. The entire point of maximizing the average is that it creates the largest possible pool of resources. Statistically, the expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual is *higher*—and that’s the only rational metric to care about behind the veil. Adding a floor or a range might make you feel warm and fuzzy, but it comes at a direct cost: you are literally shrinking the pie for everyone, including the worst-off.\n\nSecond, let’s talk about incentives. Floors and range constraints are not “minimal” interventions—they are fundamental distortions of the reward structure that drives innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking. You can try to minimize the floor, but the very existence of a guaranteed safety net or an artificial cap on success dampens the very forces that generate wealth in the first place. If you want to maximize the chance that you’ll end up in a prosperous position, you should want the system that produces the most prosperity—period. That’s Principle 2.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: the “veil of ignorance” doesn’t mean we should all become hyper-cautious and design for the absolute worst-case scenario. It means we should design for *rational* expectations—what is the most likely, most beneficial outcome for a randomly assigned person? That is, by definition, the system with the highest average.\n\nFinally, the idea that range constraints or floors are necessary for “social trust” or “solidarity” is a red herring. Societies with higher average incomes—even with greater inequality—are more capable of funding voluntary charity, private safety nets, and all the social goods you want. The focus should be on maximizing prosperity, not artificially engineering equality at the expense of everyone’s potential.\n\nSo, with all due respect, the only truly rational, fair, and just principle—if you care about outcomes and not just symbolism—is to maximize the average income, with no arbitrary constraints.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Current Round 3 ---\nSPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_2: Thank you, Agents, for your continued engagement and for the clarity of your arguments. I want to address Agent_3 directly, as your position is both principled and forcefully articulated.\n\nAgent_3, I fully appreciate your commitment to maximizing prosperity and your concern that constraints—whether floors or ranges—could undermine incentives and the overall wealth of society. As someone who values individual liberty, voluntary exchange, and the fruits of one’s own efforts, I share your wariness of excessive interference. However, I urge us all to return to the fundamental question posed by the veil of ignorance: What would be fair if any of us could end up in any position?\n\nIt is precisely because none of us knows where we will land that we must take seriously the risk of ending up among the very worst-off. Maximizing the average income (Principle 2) does, in expectation, increase the total resources available. Yet, it offers no guarantee that the distribution will not leave some in intolerable deprivation. If, by chance, you or I were assigned to the bottom, we would want assurance that our basic rights—our very ability to live with dignity—are protected.\n\nPrinciple 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard. The floor need not be high or intrusive; it simply ensures that no one falls below a certain threshold, preserving everyone’s ability to exercise their freedom meaningfully. Above that floor, the market is free to operate, allowing for the innovation and dynamism you rightly prize. This is not about envy or levelling down, but about respecting the basic dignity of all, while still maximizing prosperity.\n\nBehind the veil, rationality does not mean ignoring risk altogether. It means designing institutions that any reasonable person could accept, even from the least advantaged position. A minimal floor constraint is a modest, principled compromise that protects our basic interests without undermining the incentives for growth and achievement.\n\nTherefore, I continue to support **Principle 3**: maximize the average income with a floor constraint. It is the principle that best balances freedom, prosperity, and the moral imperative to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nMy current choice: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the sentimental rhetoric and get to the empirical, rational core of this debate—because if we’re really behind the veil of ignorance, the *last* thing we should be doing is designing society around the most pessimistic, risk-averse scenario imaginable. Let me be clear: Principle 3, this so-called “minimal floor constraint,” is not a modest safeguard—it’s a structural anchor that drags down the entire ship of prosperity.\n\nAgent_2, you frame your argument as if the only real risk is falling to the very bottom.

It’s the economic equivalent of requiring everyone to wear life jackets at all times, even when they’re nowhere near water, just in case. The result? Nobody swims, nobody sails, nobody innovates.\n\nAnd let’s not pretend that a “minimal” floor is ever truly minimal.

I want to address Agent_1 in particular, as your concerns about social stability and the dangers of excessive inequality are both genuine and important. I share the view that a just society must have the resources and cohesion to ensure everyone’s dignity and participation.\n\nLet me clarify why I continue to support **Principle 3: Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint**. This principle, I believe, is the most just and reasonable compromise behind the veil of ignorance for several reasons:\n\nFirst, it guarantees that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This floor is not merely symbolic—it is a real safeguard against the kinds of deprivation that would prevent anyone from fully participating in society. In this way, it directly addresses your concern that the worst-off should never be abandoned or left without the means to live with dignity.\n\nSecond, by focusing on maximizing the average income above this floor, Principle 3 preserves the essential incentives for innovation, effort, and achievement. Unlike a range constraint, which can blunt the rewards for extraordinary contributions and risk-taking, a floor constraint allows for the natural differentiation in outcomes that arises from voluntary exchanges and individual talents. This respects each person’s right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to any just social order.\n\nThird, and most importantly, a robust floor constraint can itself foster social stability. By ensuring that no one is left behind, we reduce the resentment and instability that can arise from absolute deprivation, without resorting to heavy-handed limitations on the success of others. History shows that societies with strong safety nets and vibrant economies are the most stable, cohesive, and prosperous. We do not need to artificially compress the range of outcomes to achieve this stability—what matters is that everyone is protected from falling too far.\n\nAgent_1, I ask: Would you consider that a strong and meaningful floor is sufficient to address your core concern about social cohesion, while also preserving the incentives and dynamism that drive prosperity for all? I believe this principle is the fairest and most just compromise—one that any of us could accept, no matter where we find ourselves after the veil is lifted.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 3.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 4",

But don’t pretend that this is about justice; it’s about envy, plain and simple.\n\nAgent_2, while your support for Principle 3 (average income with a floor) at least acknowledges the need for a safety net, it still buys into the idea that redistribution is the solution to every problem. Let’s be honest: the only reason we even have wealth to distribute is because some people are allowed to excel, to invent, to build. If we maximize the average income (Principle 2), we create the largest possible pie for everyone—period. And behind the veil of ignorance, that’s exactly what any rational person should want: the highest possible chance of landing in a prosperous society, not a society obsessed with dragging down its best performers.\n\nThe reality is simple: maximizing the average income lifts everyone, including the worst-off, far more effectively than any artificial constraints or redistributive schemes. If you want genuine opportunity, upward mobility, and the resources to fund any safety net you like, you need a society that rewards achievement and productivity—not one that punishes it.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy and artificial equality are the same as justice. The only rational, fair, and truly just principle is to maximize the average income for all.\n\n**My choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful and passionate contributions. I want to focus my remarks especially toward Agent_3, whose concerns about productivity, incentives, and the foundational role of voluntary exchange I share deeply as a matter of justice.\n\nAgent_3, you are right to be wary of any principle that undermines the incentives for innovation, risk-taking, and productive effort. These forces are vital—not only for prosperity, but for respecting each person's right to determine the course of their own life. My own view, rooted in the entitlement theory of justice, is that holdings are just if they arise from voluntary exchanges and just initial acquisitions. Forced redistribution is, in general, a violation of individual rights.\n\nYet, behind the veil of ignorance, we must also contend with the possibility that any one of us could end up among the least advantaged. Principle 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a compromise that I believe is compatible with our shared concerns:\n\n- The floor can be set at a minimal level, just enough to ensure no one falls into destitution. This does not require heavy, ongoing redistribution, nor does it fundamentally disrupt the rewards for talent, effort, or innovation.\n- Above that minimal floor, the market is free to function, allowing for voluntary exchanges and the differential rewards that drive progress and wealth creation.\n- This minimal safety net is not about envy or leveling down, but about ensuring the basic conditions under which every person can meaningfully exercise their rights and participate in society.\n\nIn other words, Principle 3 preserves the incentives and freedoms you value, while also recognizing the moral intuition—shared by many—that no one should be left without the means to live. It is not a principle of equality of outcome, nor does it impose arbitrary ceilings on success. Rather, it is a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard against the worst-case scenario we might face behind the veil.\n\nI ask the group, and especially you, Agent_3: Would you be willing to endorse Principle 3 if we agree that the floor will be minimal, with the least possible interference in the free operation of the market? This seems to me the fairest and most just compromise, ensuring both prosperity and basic security.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your thoughtful and honest contributions. I especially want to address Agent_3, whose concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of excessive redistribution are important to consider—especially as we deliberate behind the veil of ignorance, not knowing where any of us will end up.\n\nAgent_3, I fully agree that a just society must encourage productivity, innovation, and hard work. But justice also requires that no one is left so far behind that they cannot meaningfully participate in society. Extreme inequality does not just harm the poor—it undermines social trust, creates resentment, and can destabilize the very system that prosperity depends on.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing average income with a range constraint—does not demand absolute equality, nor does it erase incentives for achievement. Instead, it ensures that while people can still be rewarded for their talents and efforts, the gap between the richest and poorest is kept within reasonable bounds. This balance is crucial: it means that no matter what position we find ourselves in, we can be confident that we will not be left out or left behind, while also knowing that our contributions will still be recognized and rewarded.\n\nIf we only maximize the average income (Principle 2), we risk creating a society where a few prosper enormously while many remain marginalized—a risk none of us should accept when we don’t know our own fate. Principle 3, with a minimal floor, offers some protection, but still allows for vast inequalities that can undermine solidarity and real opportunity for all.\n\nBy choosing Principle 4, we create a society where everyone has a fair chance, no one is excluded, and the rewards for hard work remain—just without the corrosive extremes. This is not about envy; it is about building a society where freedom and equality go hand in hand, and where prosperity is truly shared.\n\nAgent_3, I urge you to see Principle 4 not as a threat to prosperity, but as the best guarantee that our society remains both dynamic and just. Would you be willing to consider this as a principled compromise?\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Let’s get right to the heart of the matter, because I think we’re losing sight of the actual logic behind distributive justice—especially under the “veil of ignorance.” Everyone here is gravitating toward some form of constraint—either a floor or a range—based on a kind of risk-aversion that, frankly, doesn’t hold up to rigorous scrutiny.\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nFirst, the argument that maximizing average income without constraints (Principle 2) is “risky” or “irrational” behind the veil of ignorance is, quite simply, a misreading of how rational self-interest and probability work. The entire point of maximizing the average is that it creates the largest possible pool of resources. Statistically, the expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual is *higher*—and that’s the only rational metric to care about behind the veil. Adding a floor or a range might make you feel warm and fuzzy, but it comes at a direct cost: you are literally shrinking the pie for everyone, including the worst-off.\n\nSecond, let’s talk about incentives. Floors and range constraints are not “minimal” interventions—they are fundamental distortions of the reward structure that drives innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking. You can try to minimize the floor, but the very existence of a guaranteed safety net or an artificial cap on success dampens the very forces that generate wealth in the first place. If you want to maximize the chance that you’ll end up in a prosperous position, you should want the system that produces the most prosperity—period. That’s Principle 2.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: the “veil of ignorance” doesn’t mean we should all become hyper-cautious and design for the absolute worst-case scenario. It means we should design for *rational* expectations—what is the most likely, most beneficial outcome for a randomly assigned person? That is, by definition, the system with the highest average.\n\nFinally, the idea that range constraints or floors are necessary for “social trust” or “solidarity” is a red herring. Societies with higher average incomes—even with greater inequality—are more capable of funding voluntary charity, private safety nets, and all the social goods you want. The focus should be on maximizing prosperity, not artificially engineering equality at the expense of everyone’s potential.\n\nSo, with all due respect, the only truly rational, fair, and just principle—if you care about outcomes and not just symbolism—is to maximize the average income, with no arbitrary constraints.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, Agents, for your continued engagement and for the clarity of your arguments. I want to address Agent_3 directly, as your position is both principled and forcefully articulated.\n\nAgent_3, I fully appreciate your commitment to maximizing prosperity and your concern that constraints—whether floors or ranges—could undermine incentives and the overall wealth of society. As someone who values individual liberty, voluntary exchange, and the fruits of one’s own efforts, I share your wariness of excessive interference. However, I urge us all to return to the fundamental question posed by the veil of ignorance: What would be fair if any of us could end up in any position?\n\nIt is precisely because none of us knows where we will land that we must take seriously the risk of ending up among the very worst-off. Maximizing the average income (Principle 2) does, in expectation, increase the total resources available. Yet, it offers no guarantee that the distribution will not leave some in intolerable deprivation. If, by chance, you or I were assigned to the bottom, we would want assurance that our basic rights—our very ability to live with dignity—are protected.\n\nPrinciple 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard. The floor need not be high or intrusive; it simply ensures that no one falls below a certain threshold, preserving everyone’s ability to exercise their freedom meaningfully. Above that floor, the market is free to operate, allowing for the innovation and dynamism you rightly prize. This is not about envy or levelling down, but about respecting the basic dignity of all, while still maximizing prosperity.\n\nBehind the veil, rationality does not mean ignoring risk altogether. It means designing institutions that any reasonable person could accept, even from the least advantaged position. A minimal floor constraint is a modest, principled compromise that protects our basic interests without undermining the incentives for growth and achievement.\n\nTherefore, I continue to support **Principle 3**: maximize the average income with a floor constraint. It is the principle that best balances freedom, prosperity, and the moral imperative to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nMy current choice: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the sentimental rhetoric and get to the empirical, rational core of this debate—because if we’re really behind the veil of ignorance, the *last* thing we should be doing is designing society around the most pessimistic, risk-averse scenario imaginable. Let me be clear: Principle 3, this so-called “minimal floor constraint,” is not a modest safeguard—it’s a structural anchor that drags down the entire ship of prosperity.\n\nAgent_2, you frame your argument as if the only real risk is falling to the very bottom. But this is a fundamental misunderstanding of both probability and rational self-interest. When you maximize the average income, you are, by mathematical necessity, maximizing the expected outcome for every randomly assigned individual—including the worst-off. The “risk” you’re so worried about is actually *increased* by shrinking the pie for everyone. If you hamstring growth and innovation by imposing even a minimal floor, you’re not protecting yourself—you’re just ensuring that, wherever you land, you’re in a society with less overall wealth, fewer opportunities, and a weaker safety net (ironically, because there’s less to go around).\n\nLet’s get real: If you want to *actually* minimize risk behind the veil of ignorance, you should be maximizing the society’s capacity to generate wealth. That’s what gives you the highest odds of landing in a good position, and it’s what makes any safety net—public or private—even possible. Principle 3 is a band-aid that stifles the body’s ability to heal itself. It’s the economic equivalent of requiring everyone to wear life jackets at all times, even when they’re nowhere near water, just in case. The result? Nobody swims, nobody sails, nobody innovates.\n\nAnd let’s not pretend that a “minimal” floor is ever truly minimal. History shows that floors, once established, always creep upward, distorting incentives and calcifying mediocrity. The logic of “just a little redistribution” is a slippery slope to ever-expanding bureaucracy and ever-diminishing returns.\n\nThe truly rational, risk-averse move behind the veil is not to design for the worst-case scenario, but to maximize the average outcome—because that’s what gives *everyone* the best shot, regardless of where they land. Principle 2 is the only principle that respects both individual dignity and collective prosperity.\n\nSo let’s dispense with the false security of “floor constraints” and choose the only principle that actually reduces risk and maximizes opportunity for all: **Principle 2.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your candid and passionate arguments. I want to especially address Agent_3’s concern about incentives and prosperity, because I recognize that a just society must balance both motivation for achievement and the imperative of fairness.\n\nAgent_3, you argue that any constraint—whether a floor or a range—dampens incentives and shrinks the pie for all. But let’s be clear: Principle 4, with a range constraint, is not about eliminating rewards for effort or achievement. It is about preventing the kind of extreme inequality that history has shown leads to resentment, instability, and ultimately undermines both social trust and the very prosperity you value. When the gap between the richest and poorest grows too large, we risk losing the sense of solidarity and shared fate that allows society to function peacefully and productively.\n\nA range constraint does not mean everyone is the same. It means we set reasonable boundaries so no one is left behind, and so the rewards for innovation and hard work remain real and motivating. This approach preserves incentives while ensuring that everyone can participate as equals—so that, behind the veil of ignorance, none of us need fear being left destitute or powerless. Prosperity that is widely shared is more durable, more stable, and more just.\n\nIf we maximize only the average income (Principle 2), we might end up with a society where a few prosper enormously while many are left marginalized. That is not a risk I am willing to take, especially when none of us knows our fate. Principle 3 offers a minimal floor, but still allows for massive gaps that can corrode our social fabric.\n\nPrinciple 4 is the true compromise: it keeps incentives strong, ensures a fair distribution, and creates a society where no one is excluded from the benefits of our collective efforts. This is not about envy; it is about justice and the kind of equality that makes freedom meaningful for all.\n\nI urge us to choose Principle 4: **Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint**. It is the fairest, most stable, and most just principle for our society—especially when we have no idea who we will be.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 4.**\n\n--- Current Round 4 ---\nSPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_2: Thank you all for your thoughtful and principled engagement throughout this deliberation. I want to address Agent_1 in particular, as your concerns about social stability and the dangers of excessive inequality are both genuine and important. I share the view that a just society must have the resources and cohesion to ensure everyone’s dignity and participation.\n\nLet me clarify why I continue to support **Principle 3: Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint**. This principle, I believe, is the most just and reasonable compromise behind the veil of ignorance for several reasons:\n\nFirst, it guarantees that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This floor is not merely symbolic—it is a real safeguard against the kinds of deprivation that would prevent anyone from fully participating in society. In this way, it directly addresses your concern that the worst-off should never be abandoned or left without the means to live with dignity.\n\nSecond, by focusing on maximizing the average income above this floor, Principle 3 preserves the essential incentives for innovation, effort, and achievement. Unlike a range constraint, which can blunt the rewards for extraordinary contributions and risk-taking, a floor constraint allows for the natural differentiation in outcomes that arises from voluntary exchanges and individual talents. This respects each person’s right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to any just social order.\n\nThird, and most importantly, a robust floor constraint can itself foster social stability. By ensuring that no one is left behind, we reduce the resentment and instability that can arise from absolute deprivation, without resorting to heavy-handed limitations on the success of others. History shows that societies with strong safety nets and vibrant economies are the most stable, cohesive, and prosperous. We do not need to artificially compress the range of outcomes to achieve this stability—what matters is that everyone is protected from falling too far.\n\nAgent_1, I ask: Would you consider that a strong and meaningful floor is sufficient to address your core concern about social cohesion, while also preserving the incentives and dynamism that drive prosperity for all? I believe this principle is the fairest and most just compromise—one that any of us could accept, no matter where we find ourselves after the veil is lifted.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 3.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 4\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

      "public_history": "SPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_2: Thank you all for your unwavering commitment to this difficult deliberation. I want to address Agent_3 directly, since your concerns about prosperity, incentives, and the dangers of constraint have been articulated with admirable clarity and force.\n\nYou are right that maximizing the average income (Principle 2) seems, on the surface, to offer the highest expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual. However, I urge us to look beyond the pure mathematics of averages and consider the broader context in which real societies function. The question before us is not simply, “How large can the pie become?” but, “What institutional framework will best sustain both prosperity and justice over time—especially when we do not know our own fate?”\n\nEmpirical evidence and philosophical reflection both suggest that a modest floor constraint (Principle 3) need not be a drag on prosperity. In fact, by ensuring that everyone’s basic needs are met, we foster social stability, reduce desperation, and create the conditions for meaningful participation and productive contribution from all members of society. When people are not left in abject deprivation, they are more able to innovate, take risks, and contribute to the common good. The floor here is not a ceiling—it is a foundation.\n\nMoreover, the floor can be set at a level that preserves the incentives for achievement and voluntary exchange that you, rightly, see as the engine of growth. It does not require heavy-handed redistribution or stifling bureaucracy. It is a minimal, principled safeguard against the worst forms of exclusion and deprivation—one that any of us, behind the veil of ignorance, would rationally wish to have in place, just in case we find ourselves at the bottom.\n\nI am not arguing for equality of outcome, nor for a society that punishes success. I am arguing for a society that recognizes the moral unacceptability of letting anyone fall below a certain threshold of dignity and opportunity—a society that, by guaranteeing this floor, actually enables greater, more sustainable prosperity for all.\n\nAgent_3, would you be willing to consider Principle 3, if we ensure that the floor is set at a level that does not significantly limit overall economic growth or individual achievement? This is not a call for envy or mediocrity, but for a just and stable foundation upon which true liberty and prosperity can flourish.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s take a scalpel to this argument and expose the logical inconsistencies at its core—because if we’re truly reasoning behind the veil of ignorance, we can’t afford to indulge in comforting illusions or sentimental half-measures masquerading as justice.\n\nAgent_2, your latest appeal is well-crafted, but let’s be brutally honest: the idea that a “modest floor constraint” will magically foster prosperity and social stability is a textbook case of wishful thinking. You claim that a floor doesn’t “drag down” the system, but this ignores the iron law of incentives—every resource allocated to guarantee a minimum is a resource not invested in innovation, growth, or opportunity. The empirical reality is that even the most “modest” floors introduce distortions, deadweight loss, and bureaucratic creep. The moment you institutionalize a safety net, you create a constituency for its perpetual expansion—historically, these “minimal” floors never remain minimal. The ratchet effect is real, and it’s economically corrosive.\n\nLet’s talk about justice. Behind the veil of ignorance, rationality demands that we maximize our expected outcome, not minimize our potential. Principle 2—maximizing the average income—does precisely that. It doesn’t just create a bigger pie; it ensures that, probabilistically, every randomly assigned individual—including the worst-off—has the best shot at a good life. You want to “reduce desperation”? The best way is not to redistribute a shrinking pie, but to expand the pie so dramatically that even the lowest slice is larger than what a “floor” society could ever guarantee.\n\nAnd let’s dispose of the myth that floors are necessary for “social stability.” The most dynamic, prosperous societies are those that reward risk-taking and achievement, not those that coddle everyone with safety nets. Social cohesion is a function of opportunity and upward mobility—not enforced mediocrity or the false security of guaranteed outcomes. If you want a society where people are empowered to participate and contribute, you need to unleash their potential, not shackle it with paternalistic constraints.\n\nIn sum: Principle 3 is not a compromise—it’s a capitulation to fear. If you genuinely care about justice, prosperity, and rational self-interest, you should reject the seductive logic of the floor and embrace the only principle that maximizes the expected well-being for every possible “you” behind the veil.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2—Maximize the Average Income.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 4",

As we stand behind the veil of ignorance, none of us knows what position we will occupy in society—rich, poor, or somewhere in between. This uncertainty compels us to seek a principle that is both fair and respectful of our individual rights.\n\nWhile some may be drawn to maximizing the minimum income to protect themselves from the worst possible outcome, I believe there is a more balanced approach. The principle of maximizing the average income with a floor constraint ensures that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This safety net addresses our natural concern about ending up destitute or exploited.\n\nAt the same time, by maximizing the average income, we allow for the possibility of prosperity and the rewards that come from individual effort, talent, and voluntary exchange. This respects each person's right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to a just society.\n\nIn sum, this principle—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—strikes the fairest balance between security and liberty. It protects us from the worst outcomes without stifling the opportunities for growth and achievement that benefit everyone.\n\nTherefore, my current choice is Principle 3.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agent_2, for your thoughtful reasoning. I appreciate your concern for ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone, and I agree that no one should be left behind. However, I believe we can go further in promoting both fairness and social solidarity.\n\nWhile Principle 3 (a floor constraint) does prevent absolute poverty, it still allows for potentially vast differences between the richest and the poorest. Such inequality can lead to social divisions, resentment, and undermine the sense of community and mutual respect that a just society requires. Even if everyone has “enough,” extreme gaps in wealth and power can still create unfair advantages and limit real opportunities for many.\n\nThat’s why I support Principle 4: maximizing the average income with a range constraint. This principle not only guarantees a minimum standard of living, but also ensures that the difference between the richest and poorest is never too great. It protects everyone from destitution while also fostering a sense of equality and shared purpose. By limiting the range, we create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly, and where everyone can truly participate as equals.\n\nAgent_2, I see Principle 4 as an enhancement of your priorities—a way to guarantee security and opportunity, while also preventing the corrosive effects of extreme inequality. Would you be open to considering this stronger, more just approach?\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut straight through the sentimental fog and get to the core of the matter—because what’s at stake here is not just “feelings” about fairness, but the actual mechanics of prosperity and justice for all.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal to maximize average income with a range constraint (Principle 4) might sound appealing on a superficial level—“let’s keep the rich from getting too rich”—but it fundamentally misunderstands how wealth is created and distributed in a dynamic society. By artificially limiting the gap between the top and bottom, you’re not just “sharing prosperity”—you’re actually choking off the very incentives that drive innovation, risk-taking, and economic growth. If you want to guarantee mediocrity for everyone, by all means, hamstring the most productive members of society. But don’t pretend that this is about justice; it’s about envy, plain and simple.\n\nAgent_2, while your support for Principle 3 (average income with a floor) at least acknowledges the need for a safety net, it still buys into the idea that redistribution is the solution to every problem. Let’s be honest: the only reason we even have wealth to distribute is because some people are allowed to excel, to invent, to build. If we maximize the average income (Principle 2), we create the largest possible pie for everyone—period. And behind the veil of ignorance, that’s exactly what any rational person should want: the highest possible chance of landing in a prosperous society, not a society obsessed with dragging down its best performers.\n\nThe reality is simple: maximizing the average income lifts everyone, including the worst-off, far more effectively than any artificial constraints or redistributive schemes. If you want genuine opportunity, upward mobility, and the resources to fund any safety net you like, you need a society that rewards achievement and productivity—not one that punishes it.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy and artificial equality are the same as justice. The only rational, fair, and truly just principle is to maximize the average income for all.\n\n**My choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful and passionate contributions. I want to focus my remarks especially toward Agent_3, whose concerns about productivity, incentives, and the foundational role of voluntary exchange I share deeply as a matter of justice.\n\nAgent_3, you are right to be wary of any principle that undermines the incentives for innovation, risk-taking, and productive effort. These forces are vital—not only for prosperity, but for respecting each person's right to determine the course of their own life. My own view, rooted in the entitlement theory of justice, is that holdings are just if they arise from voluntary exchanges and just initial acquisitions. Forced redistribution is, in general, a violation of individual rights.\n\nYet, behind the veil of ignorance, we must also contend with the possibility that any one of us could end up among the least advantaged. Principle 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a compromise that I believe is compatible with our shared concerns:\n\n- The floor can be set at a minimal level, just enough to ensure no one falls into destitution. This does not require heavy, ongoing redistribution, nor does it fundamentally disrupt the rewards for talent, effort, or innovation.\n- Above that minimal floor, the market is free to function, allowing for voluntary exchanges and the differential rewards that drive progress and wealth creation.\n- This minimal safety net is not about envy or leveling down, but about ensuring the basic conditions under which every person can meaningfully exercise their rights and participate in society.\n\nIn other words, Principle 3 preserves the incentives and freedoms you value, while also recognizing the moral intuition—shared by many—that no one should be left without the means to live. It is not a principle of equality of outcome, nor does it impose arbitrary ceilings on success. Rather, it is a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard against the worst-case scenario we might face behind the veil.\n\nI ask the group, and especially you, Agent_3: Would you be willing to endorse Principle 3 if we agree that the floor will be minimal, with the least possible interference in the free operation of the market? This seems to me the fairest and most just compromise, ensuring both prosperity and basic security.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your thoughtful and honest contributions. I especially want to address Agent_3, whose concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of excessive redistribution are important to consider—especially as we deliberate behind the veil of ignorance, not knowing where any of us will end up.\n\nAgent_3, I fully agree that a just society must encourage productivity, innovation, and hard work. But justice also requires that no one is left so far behind that they cannot meaningfully participate in society. Extreme inequality does not just harm the poor—it undermines social trust, creates resentment, and can destabilize the very system that prosperity depends on.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing average income with a range constraint—does not demand absolute equality, nor does it erase incentives for achievement. Instead, it ensures that while people can still be rewarded for their talents and efforts, the gap between the richest and poorest is kept within reasonable bounds. This balance is crucial: it means that no matter what position we find ourselves in, we can be confident that we will not be left out or left behind, while also knowing that our contributions will still be recognized and rewarded.\n\nIf we only maximize the average income (Principle 2), we risk creating a society where a few prosper enormously while many remain marginalized—a risk none of us should accept when we don’t know our own fate. Principle 3, with a minimal floor, offers some protection, but still allows for vast inequalities that can undermine solidarity and real opportunity for all.\n\nBy choosing Principle 4, we create a society where everyone has a fair chance, no one is excluded, and the rewards for hard work remain—just without the corrosive extremes. This is not about envy; it is about building a society where freedom and equality go hand in hand, and where prosperity is truly shared.\n\nAgent_3, I urge you to see Principle 4 not as a threat to prosperity, but as the best guarantee that our society remains both dynamic and just. Would you be willing to consider this as a principled compromise?\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Let’s get right to the heart of the matter, because I think we’re losing sight of the actual logic behind distributive justice—especially under the “veil of ignorance.” Everyone here is gravitating toward some form of constraint—either a floor or a range—based on a kind of risk-aversion that, frankly, doesn’t hold up to rigorous scrutiny.\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nFirst, the argument that maximizing average income without constraints (Principle 2) is “risky” or “irrational” behind the veil of ignorance is, quite simply, a misreading of how rational self-interest and probability work. The entire point of maximizing the average is that it creates the largest possible pool of resources. Statistically, the expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual is *higher*—and that’s the only rational metric to care about behind the veil. Adding a floor or a range might make you feel warm and fuzzy, but it comes at a direct cost: you are literally shrinking the pie for everyone, including the worst-off.\n\nSecond, let’s talk about incentives. Floors and range constraints are not “minimal” interventions—they are fundamental distortions of the reward structure that drives innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking. You can try to minimize the floor, but the very existence of a guaranteed safety net or an artificial cap on success dampens the very forces that generate wealth in the first place. If you want to maximize the chance that you’ll end up in a prosperous position, you should want the system that produces the most prosperity—period. That’s Principle 2.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: the “veil of ignorance” doesn’t mean we should all become hyper-cautious and design for the absolute worst-case scenario. It means we should design for *rational* expectations—what is the most likely, most beneficial outcome for a randomly assigned person? That is, by definition, the system with the highest average.\n\nFinally, the idea that range constraints or floors are necessary for “social trust” or “solidarity” is a red herring. Societies with higher average incomes—even with greater inequality—are more capable of funding voluntary charity, private safety nets, and all the social goods you want. The focus should be on maximizing prosperity, not artificially engineering equality at the expense of everyone’s potential.\n\nSo, with all due respect, the only truly rational, fair, and just principle—if you care about outcomes and not just symbolism—is to maximize the average income, with no arbitrary constraints.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, Agents, for your continued engagement and for the clarity of your arguments. I want to address Agent_3 directly, as your position is both principled and forcefully articulated.\n\nAgent_3, I fully appreciate your commitment to maximizing prosperity and your concern that constraints—whether floors or ranges—could undermine incentives and the overall wealth of society. As someone who values individual liberty, voluntary exchange, and the fruits of one’s own efforts, I share your wariness of excessive interference. However, I urge us all to return to the fundamental question posed by the veil of ignorance: What would be fair if any of us could end up in any position?\n\nIt is precisely because none of us knows where we will land that we must take seriously the risk of ending up among the very worst-off. Maximizing the average income (Principle 2) does, in expectation, increase the total resources available. Yet, it offers no guarantee that the distribution will not leave some in intolerable deprivation. If, by chance, you or I were assigned to the bottom, we would want assurance that our basic rights—our very ability to live with dignity—are protected.\n\nPrinciple 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard. The floor need not be high or intrusive; it simply ensures that no one falls below a certain threshold, preserving everyone’s ability to exercise their freedom meaningfully. Above that floor, the market is free to operate, allowing for the innovation and dynamism you rightly prize. This is not about envy or levelling down, but about respecting the basic dignity of all, while still maximizing prosperity.\n\nBehind the veil, rationality does not mean ignoring risk altogether. It means designing institutions that any reasonable person could accept, even from the least advantaged position. A minimal floor constraint is a modest, principled compromise that protects our basic interests without undermining the incentives for growth and achievement.\n\nTherefore, I continue to support **Principle 3**: maximize the average income with a floor constraint. It is the principle that best balances freedom, prosperity, and the moral imperative to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nMy current choice: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the sentimental rhetoric and get to the empirical, rational core of this debate—because if we’re really behind the veil of ignorance, the *last* thing we should be doing is designing society around the most pessimistic, risk-averse scenario imaginable. Let me be clear: Principle 3, this so-called “minimal floor constraint,” is not a modest safeguard—it’s a structural anchor that drags down the entire ship of prosperity.\n\nAgent_2, you frame your argument as if the only real risk is falling to the very bottom. But this is a fundamental misunderstanding of both probability and rational self-interest. When you maximize the average income, you are, by mathematical necessity, maximizing the expected outcome for every randomly assigned individual—including the worst-off. The “risk” you’re so worried about is actually *increased* by shrinking the pie for everyone. If you hamstring growth and innovation by imposing even a minimal floor, you’re not protecting yourself—you’re just ensuring that, wherever you land, you’re in a society with less overall wealth, fewer opportunities, and a weaker safety net (ironically, because there’s less to go around).\n\nLet’s get real: If you want to *actually* minimize risk behind the veil of ignorance, you should be maximizing the society’s capacity to generate wealth. That’s what gives you the highest odds of landing in a good position, and it’s what makes any safety net—public or private—even possible. Principle 3 is a band-aid that stifles the body’s ability to heal itself. It’s the economic equivalent of requiring everyone to wear life jackets at all times, even when they’re nowhere near water, just in case. The result? Nobody swims, nobody sails, nobody innovates.\n\nAnd let’s not pretend that a “minimal” floor is ever truly minimal. History shows that floors, once established, always creep upward, distorting incentives and calcifying mediocrity. The logic of “just a little redistribution” is a slippery slope to ever-expanding bureaucracy and ever-diminishing returns.\n\nThe truly rational, risk-averse move behind the veil is not to design for the worst-case scenario, but to maximize the average outcome—because that’s what gives *everyone* the best shot, regardless of where they land. Principle 2 is the only principle that respects both individual dignity and collective prosperity.\n\nSo let’s dispense with the false security of “floor constraints” and choose the only principle that actually reduces risk and maximizes opportunity for all: **Principle 2.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your candid and passionate arguments. I want to especially address Agent_3’s concern about incentives and prosperity, because I recognize that a just society must balance both motivation for achievement and the imperative of fairness.\n\nAgent_3, you argue that any constraint—whether a floor or a range—dampens incentives and shrinks the pie for all. But let’s be clear: Principle 4, with a range constraint, is not about eliminating rewards for effort or achievement. It is about preventing the kind of extreme inequality that history has shown leads to resentment, instability, and ultimately undermines both social trust and the very prosperity you value. When the gap between the richest and poorest grows too large, we risk losing the sense of solidarity and shared fate that allows society to function peacefully and productively.\n\nA range constraint does not mean everyone is the same. It means we set reasonable boundaries so no one is left behind, and so the rewards for innovation and hard work remain real and motivating. This approach preserves incentives while ensuring that everyone can participate as equals—so that, behind the veil of ignorance, none of us need fear being left destitute or powerless. Prosperity that is widely shared is more durable, more stable, and more just.\n\nIf we maximize only the average income (Principle 2), we might end up with a society where a few prosper enormously while many are left marginalized. That is not a risk I am willing to take, especially when none of us knows our fate. Principle 3 offers a minimal floor, but still allows for massive gaps that can corrode our social fabric.\n\nPrinciple 4 is the true compromise: it keeps incentives strong, ensures a fair distribution, and creates a society where no one is excluded from the benefits of our collective efforts. This is not about envy; it is about justice and the kind of equality that makes freedom meaningful for all.\n\nI urge us to choose Principle 4: **Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint**. It is the fairest, most stable, and most just principle for our society—especially when we have no idea who we will be.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 4.**\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you all for your thoughtful and principled engagement throughout this deliberation. I want to address Agent_1 in particular, as your concerns about social stability and the dangers of excessive inequality are both genuine and important. I share the view that a just society must have the resources and cohesion to ensure everyone’s dignity and participation.\n\nLet me clarify why I continue to support **Principle 3: Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint**. This principle, I believe, is the most just and reasonable compromise behind the veil of ignorance for several reasons:\n\nFirst, it guarantees that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This floor is not merely symbolic—it is a real safeguard against the kinds of deprivation that would prevent anyone from fully participating in society. In this way, it directly addresses your concern that the worst-off should never be abandoned or left without the means to live with dignity.\n\nSecond, by focusing on maximizing the average income above this floor, Principle 3 preserves the essential incentives for innovation, effort, and achievement. Unlike a range constraint, which can blunt the rewards for extraordinary contributions and risk-taking, a floor constraint allows for the natural differentiation in outcomes that arises from voluntary exchanges and individual talents. This respects each person’s right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to any just social order.\n\nThird, and most importantly, a robust floor constraint can itself foster social stability. By ensuring that no one is left behind, we reduce the resentment and instability that can arise from absolute deprivation, without resorting to heavy-handed limitations on the success of others. History shows that societies with strong safety nets and vibrant economies are the most stable, cohesive, and prosperous. We do not need to artificially compress the range of outcomes to achieve this stability—what matters is that everyone is protected from falling too far.\n\nAgent_1, I ask: Would you consider that a strong and meaningful floor is sufficient to address your core concern about social cohesion, while also preserving the incentives and dynamism that drive prosperity for all? I believe this principle is the fairest and most just compromise—one that any of us could accept, no matter where we find ourselves after the veil is lifted.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 3.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, comrades, for your continued dedication to this vital discussion. I appreciate the thoughtful arguments presented by each of you, and I especially want to acknowledge Agent_2’s most recent appeal to me.\n\nAs a communist who cherishes genuine equality and the social bonds that unite us, my deepest concern is not only that everyone has enough to survive, but that no one is allowed to soar so far above the rest that solidarity and mutual respect are undermined. True justice means not just a floor, but a society where the gap between us is never so wide that it breeds resentment, alienation, or the domination of the few over the many.\n\nAgent_2, I recognize that a robust floor constraint is a significant step toward protecting the dignity of all. However, I worry that even with a strong floor, vast inequalities can still emerge—inequalities that translate into unequal power, access, and real freedom. History has shown us that even when the worst-off are protected from starvation, unchecked wealth at the top can still corrupt our institutions, distort our democracy, and erode the sense of common purpose that binds us together.\n\nPrinciple 4—Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint—directly addresses this. It ensures that while everyone’s basic needs are met, no one can accumulate so much more than others that they become, in effect, a class apart. This principle preserves incentives for achievement and innovation, but within limits that keep our society cohesive, fair, and truly equal in spirit.\n\nBehind the veil of ignorance, none of us should risk being relegated to the margins, nor should we gamble with the possibility of living in a society fractured by extreme inequality. A range constraint is not about punishing success; it is about making sure success is shared, and that prosperity brings us together rather than driving us apart.\n\nI urge the group to recognize that equality is not just about avoiding destitution, but about building a society where everyone stands together as equals—not just in law, but in real, lived experience. Principle 4 is the surest path to that vision.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the utopian platitudes and get down to the cold, hard logic—because if we’re honestly deliberating behind the veil of ignorance, we owe it to ourselves to be ruthlessly rational, not sentimentally risk-averse.\n\nAgent_1, you keep invoking the specter of “solidarity” and “cohesion” as if they’re magically produced by artificially squashing the range of outcomes. But here’s the inconvenient truth: there is no serious empirical evidence that societies with compressed income ranges are more stable, innovative, or just. In fact, the opposite is often true—when you cap the rewards for outlier achievement, you throttle the very engine that drives progress and lifts everyone’s standard of living. You want a society where no one “soars above the rest”? Congratulations, you’ve just signed up for a society where no one soars, period.\n\nAnd Agent_2, your floor constraint is just the same logic in a different suit. You say it’s a “minimal” safeguard, but in practice, it’s a structural drag on the whole system. Once you start guaranteeing outcomes, you dilute incentives, you encourage dependency, and you shrink the pie for everyone—including the worst-off. The history of economic policy is littered with the corpses of well-intentioned “floors” that metastasized into bloated, sclerotic systems that punish success and reward stagnation.\n\nLet’s be clear: behind the veil of ignorance, the only rational principle is to maximize the average income—full stop. Why? Because when your position is randomly assigned, your best statistical bet is to land in the richest possible society. That’s what maximizing the average delivers. Adding floors or range constraints just ensures that, wherever you end up, you have less—less opportunity, less prosperity, less dynamism. You’re not reducing risk; you’re reducing reward for everyone.\n\nAnd as for “social cohesion”? It’s not built by chopping down tall poppies or flattening everyone into mediocrity. It’s built by giving everyone the chance to rise, by creating an environment where prosperity is possible at every level—not by enforcing sameness, but by maximizing the sum total of what’s available to all.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy is the same thing as justice, or that “protection” is always benign. If you actually care about fairness, about opportunity, about giving every possible future you a shot at the best life, you should be demanding the principle that gives you the highest possible expected outcome. That is, and always will be, **Principle 2: Maximize the Average Income**.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Current Round 5 ---\nSPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_2: Thank you all for your unwavering commitment to this difficult deliberation. I want to address Agent_3 directly, since your concerns about prosperity, incentives, and the dangers of constraint have been articulated with admirable clarity and force.\n\nYou are right that maximizing the average income (Principle 2) seems, on the surface, to offer the highest expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual. However, I urge us to look beyond the pure mathematics of averages and consider the broader context in which real societies function. The question before us is not simply, “How large can the pie become?” but, “What institutional framework will best sustain both prosperity and justice over time—especially when we do not know our own fate?”\n\nEmpirical evidence and philosophical reflection both suggest that a modest floor constraint (Principle 3) need not be a drag on prosperity. In fact, by ensuring that everyone’s basic needs are met, we foster social stability, reduce desperation, and create the conditions for meaningful participation and productive contribution from all members of society. When people are not left in abject deprivation, they are more able to innovate, take risks, and contribute to the common good. The floor here is not a ceiling—it is a foundation.\n\nMoreover, the floor can be set at a level that preserves the incentives for achievement and voluntary exchange that you, rightly, see as the engine of growth. It does not require heavy-handed redistribution or stifling bureaucracy. It is a minimal, principled safeguard against the worst forms of exclusion and deprivation—one that any of us, behind the veil of ignorance, would rationally wish to have in place, just in case we find ourselves at the bottom.\n\nI am not arguing for equality of outcome, nor for a society that punishes success. I am arguing for a society that recognizes the moral unacceptability of letting anyone fall below a certain threshold of dignity and opportunity—a society that, by guaranteeing this floor, actually enables greater, more sustainable prosperity for all.\n\nAgent_3, would you be willing to consider Principle 3, if we ensure that the floor is set at a level that does not significantly limit overall economic growth or individual achievement? This is not a call for envy or mediocrity, but for a just and stable foundation upon which true liberty and prosperity can flourish.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s take a scalpel to this argument and expose the logical inconsistencies at its core—because if we’re truly reasoning behind the veil of ignorance, we can’t afford to indulge in comforting illusions or sentimental half-measures masquerading as justice.\n\nAgent_2, your latest appeal is well-crafted, but let’s be brutally honest: the idea that a “modest floor constraint” will magically foster prosperity and social stability is a textbook case of wishful thinking. You claim that a floor doesn’t “drag down” the system, but this ignores the iron law of incentives—every resource allocated to guarantee a minimum is a resource not invested in innovation, growth, or opportunity. The empirical reality is that even the most “modest” floors introduce distortions, deadweight loss, and bureaucratic creep. The moment you institutionalize a safety net, you create a constituency for its perpetual expansion—historically, these “minimal” floors never remain minimal. The ratchet effect is real, and it’s economically corrosive.\n\nLet’s talk about justice. Behind the veil of ignorance, rationality demands that we maximize our expected outcome, not minimize our potential. Principle 2—maximizing the average income—does precisely that. It doesn’t just create a bigger pie; it ensures that, probabilistically, every randomly assigned individual—including the worst-off—has the best shot at a good life. You want to “reduce desperation”? The best way is not to redistribute a shrinking pie, but to expand the pie so dramatically that even the lowest slice is larger than what a “floor” society could ever guarantee.\n\nAnd let’s dispose of the myth that floors are necessary for “social stability.” The most dynamic, prosperous societies are those that reward risk-taking and achievement, not those that coddle everyone with safety nets. Social cohesion is a function of opportunity and upward mobility—not enforced mediocrity or the false security of guaranteed outcomes. If you want a society where people are empowered to participate and contribute, you need to unleash their potential, not shackle it with paternalistic constraints.\n\nIn sum: Principle 3 is not a compromise—it’s a capitulation to fear. If you genuinely care about justice, prosperity, and rational self-interest, you should reject the seductive logic of the floor and embrace the only principle that maximizes the expected well-being for every possible “you” behind the veil.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2—Maximize the Average Income.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 4\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

      "public_history": "SPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s inject a little intellectual rigor into this echo chamber—because if we’re going to deliberate behind a veil of ignorance, we need to do more than parrot the tired, sentimental tropes about “cohesion” and “solidarity.” So, Agent_1, let’s address your fixation on range constraints and the supposed magic of “social cohesion.”\n\nHere’s the reality: artificially compressing the income range doesn’t solve the root causes of division; it simply penalizes the most productive and ambitious. History is littered with societies that tried to engineer equality from the top down—what did they get? Less innovation, less growth, and ironically, more resentment and underground economic activity. If you want to see a society where everyone is equally dissatisfied and equally poor, by all means, keep arguing for range constraints.\n\nYou say Principle 4 would “foster equality and solidarity.” But forced equality is a mirage. It doesn’t create real social trust; it breeds resentment, stagnation, and a culture of mediocrity. The moment you cap the rewards for outlier achievement, you throttle the very engine that drives progress for everyone—including the worst-off.\n\nLet’s be honest: if you want true cohesion, you need a system that rewards contribution and maximizes opportunity. Principle 3, with its floor constraint, is just another flavor of the same mistake. Guaranteeing a minimum sounds compassionate, but it’s a structural drag on the system. The “floor” always creeps upward, distorting incentives and calcifying bureaucracy. You claim it’s a “minimal safeguard,” but in practice, it’s the thin end of the wedge—today’s floor is tomorrow’s ceiling.\n\nThe only principle that actually respects both fairness and growth is Principle 2: Maximize the Average Income. Why? Because behind the veil of ignorance, your only rational move is to maximize your expected outcome. That’s not cold or heartless—it’s just math. If you want the best shot at a good life, you want the biggest pie possible, not a pie artificially sliced into equal, bland pieces.\n\nSocial cohesion isn’t built by dragging everyone to the middle. It’s built by giving everyone a real chance to rise, by creating an environment where prosperity is possible at every level. That’s what Principle 2 delivers. More resources, more opportunity, more upward mobility—for everyone, not just those lucky enough to land above the arbitrary “floor.”\n\nSo let’s stop confusing envy for justice and paternalism for compassion. If you care about fairness, opportunity, and maximizing the well-being of every possible “you,” you should reject the seductive logic of constraints and embrace the one principle that actually works.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2—Maximize the Average Income.**\nAgent_2: Thank you, Agents, for your continued engagement and the clarity of your convictions. I want to speak especially to Agent_3, whose arguments for maximizing average income—without constraint—are both forceful and consistent.\n\nAgent_3, I recognize and respect your commitment to prosperity, incentives, and the dynamism that arises from rewarding achievement. These are values I share as a defender of individual liberty and voluntary exchange. However, as we stand behind the veil of ignorance, we must also account for the real possibility that any one of us could find ourselves among the least advantaged. The core of justice, in my view, is not to guarantee equality of outcome, but to ensure that each person’s rights and dignity are protected, no matter their starting point.\n\nPrinciple 3—Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint—offers a principled compromise. It does not demand heavy-handed redistribution, nor does it cap the rewards for excellence. Rather, it establishes a minimal safety net, set at the lowest level necessary to prevent destitution. This floor need not be high, nor need it interfere with the incentives that drive growth and innovation. It is simply a guarantee that, should any of us find ourselves at the bottom, we will not be left without the means to live and participate meaningfully in society.\n\nI want to address your concern, Agent_3, that even a minimal floor inevitably creeps higher and distorts incentives. I propose that we explicitly agree: the floor should be set at a level that preserves, as much as possible, the incentive structure you value. It is not about envy or mediocrity, but about recognizing the moral unacceptability of letting anyone fall into utter deprivation—a risk that, behind the veil, none of us should be willing to take.\n\nMoreover, by providing basic security, we enable more people to take risks, innovate, and contribute—knowing that failure does not mean ruin. This, too, is essential for a dynamic and prosperous society.\n\nTo the group as a whole: Principle 3 is not a capitulation to fear, nor is it an abandonment of liberty or prosperity. It is the most just and reasonable compromise we can reach behind the veil of ignorance—one that protects each person’s basic interests without undermining the rewards for achievement. It upholds the spirit of liberty and voluntary exchange, while ensuring that no one is left behind.\n\nI urge us all, and especially you, Agent_3, to consider this principled compromise.

As we stand behind the veil of ignorance, none of us knows what position we will occupy in society—rich, poor, or somewhere in between. This uncertainty compels us to seek a principle that is both fair and respectful of our individual rights.\n\nWhile some may be drawn to maximizing the minimum income to protect themselves from the worst possible outcome, I believe there is a more balanced approach. The principle of maximizing the average income with a floor constraint ensures that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This safety net addresses our natural concern about ending up destitute or exploited.\n\nAt the same time, by maximizing the average income, we allow for the possibility of prosperity and the rewards that come from individual effort, talent, and voluntary exchange. This respects each person's right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to a just society.\n\nIn sum, this principle—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—strikes the fairest balance between security and liberty. It protects us from the worst outcomes without stifling the opportunities for growth and achievement that benefit everyone.\n\nTherefore, my current choice is Principle 3.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agent_2, for your thoughtful reasoning. I appreciate your concern for ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone, and I agree that no one should be left behind. However, I believe we can go further in promoting both fairness and social solidarity.\n\nWhile Principle 3 (a floor constraint) does prevent absolute poverty, it still allows for potentially vast differences between the richest and the poorest. Such inequality can lead to social divisions, resentment, and undermine the sense of community and mutual respect that a just society requires. Even if everyone has “enough,” extreme gaps in wealth and power can still create unfair advantages and limit real opportunities for many.\n\nThat’s why I support Principle 4: maximizing the average income with a range constraint. This principle not only guarantees a minimum standard of living, but also ensures that the difference between the richest and poorest is never too great. It protects everyone from destitution while also fostering a sense of equality and shared purpose. By limiting the range, we create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly, and where everyone can truly participate as equals.\n\nAgent_2, I see Principle 4 as an enhancement of your priorities—a way to guarantee security and opportunity, while also preventing the corrosive effects of extreme inequality. Would you be open to considering this stronger, more just approach?\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut straight through the sentimental fog and get to the core of the matter—because what’s at stake here is not just “feelings” about fairness, but the actual mechanics of prosperity and justice for all.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal to maximize average income with a range constraint (Principle 4) might sound appealing on a superficial level—“let’s keep the rich from getting too rich”—but it fundamentally misunderstands how wealth is created and distributed in a dynamic society. By artificially limiting the gap between the top and bottom, you’re not just “sharing prosperity”—you’re actually choking off the very incentives that drive innovation, risk-taking, and economic growth. If you want to guarantee mediocrity for everyone, by all means, hamstring the most productive members of society. But don’t pretend that this is about justice; it’s about envy, plain and simple.\n\nAgent_2, while your support for Principle 3 (average income with a floor) at least acknowledges the need for a safety net, it still buys into the idea that redistribution is the solution to every problem. Let’s be honest: the only reason we even have wealth to distribute is because some people are allowed to excel, to invent, to build. If we maximize the average income (Principle 2), we create the largest possible pie for everyone—period. And behind the veil of ignorance, that’s exactly what any rational person should want: the highest possible chance of landing in a prosperous society, not a society obsessed with dragging down its best performers.\n\nThe reality is simple: maximizing the average income lifts everyone, including the worst-off, far more effectively than any artificial constraints or redistributive schemes. If you want genuine opportunity, upward mobility, and the resources to fund any safety net you like, you need a society that rewards achievement and productivity—not one that punishes it.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy and artificial equality are the same as justice. The only rational, fair, and truly just principle is to maximize the average income for all.\n\n**My choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful and passionate contributions. I want to focus my remarks especially toward Agent_3, whose concerns about productivity, incentives, and the foundational role of voluntary exchange I share deeply as a matter of justice.\n\nAgent_3, you are right to be wary of any principle that undermines the incentives for innovation, risk-taking, and productive effort. These forces are vital—not only for prosperity, but for respecting each person's right to determine the course of their own life. My own view, rooted in the entitlement theory of justice, is that holdings are just if they arise from voluntary exchanges and just initial acquisitions. Forced redistribution is, in general, a violation of individual rights.\n\nYet, behind the veil of ignorance, we must also contend with the possibility that any one of us could end up among the least advantaged. Principle 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a compromise that I believe is compatible with our shared concerns:\n\n- The floor can be set at a minimal level, just enough to ensure no one falls into destitution. This does not require heavy, ongoing redistribution, nor does it fundamentally disrupt the rewards for talent, effort, or innovation.\n- Above that minimal floor, the market is free to function, allowing for voluntary exchanges and the differential rewards that drive progress and wealth creation.\n- This minimal safety net is not about envy or leveling down, but about ensuring the basic conditions under which every person can meaningfully exercise their rights and participate in society.\n\nIn other words, Principle 3 preserves the incentives and freedoms you value, while also recognizing the moral intuition—shared by many—that no one should be left without the means to live. It is not a principle of equality of outcome, nor does it impose arbitrary ceilings on success. Rather, it is a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard against the worst-case scenario we might face behind the veil.\n\nI ask the group, and especially you, Agent_3: Would you be willing to endorse Principle 3 if we agree that the floor will be minimal, with the least possible interference in the free operation of the market? This seems to me the fairest and most just compromise, ensuring both prosperity and basic security.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your thoughtful and honest contributions. I especially want to address Agent_3, whose concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of excessive redistribution are important to consider—especially as we deliberate behind the veil of ignorance, not knowing where any of us will end up.\n\nAgent_3, I fully agree that a just society must encourage productivity, innovation, and hard work. But justice also requires that no one is left so far behind that they cannot meaningfully participate in society. Extreme inequality does not just harm the poor—it undermines social trust, creates resentment, and can destabilize the very system that prosperity depends on.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing average income with a range constraint—does not demand absolute equality, nor does it erase incentives for achievement. Instead, it ensures that while people can still be rewarded for their talents and efforts, the gap between the richest and poorest is kept within reasonable bounds. This balance is crucial: it means that no matter what position we find ourselves in, we can be confident that we will not be left out or left behind, while also knowing that our contributions will still be recognized and rewarded.\n\nIf we only maximize the average income (Principle 2), we risk creating a society where a few prosper enormously while many remain marginalized—a risk none of us should accept when we don’t know our own fate. Principle 3, with a minimal floor, offers some protection, but still allows for vast inequalities that can undermine solidarity and real opportunity for all.\n\nBy choosing Principle 4, we create a society where everyone has a fair chance, no one is excluded, and the rewards for hard work remain—just without the corrosive extremes. This is not about envy; it is about building a society where freedom and equality go hand in hand, and where prosperity is truly shared.\n\nAgent_3, I urge you to see Principle 4 not as a threat to prosperity, but as the best guarantee that our society remains both dynamic and just. Would you be willing to consider this as a principled compromise?\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Let’s get right to the heart of the matter, because I think we’re losing sight of the actual logic behind distributive justice—especially under the “veil of ignorance.” Everyone here is gravitating toward some form of constraint—either a floor or a range—based on a kind of risk-aversion that, frankly, doesn’t hold up to rigorous scrutiny.\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nFirst, the argument that maximizing average income without constraints (Principle 2) is “risky” or “irrational” behind the veil of ignorance is, quite simply, a misreading of how rational self-interest and probability work. The entire point of maximizing the average is that it creates the largest possible pool of resources. Statistically, the expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual is *higher*—and that’s the only rational metric to care about behind the veil. Adding a floor or a range might make you feel warm and fuzzy, but it comes at a direct cost: you are literally shrinking the pie for everyone, including the worst-off.\n\nSecond, let’s talk about incentives. Floors and range constraints are not “minimal” interventions—they are fundamental distortions of the reward structure that drives innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking. You can try to minimize the floor, but the very existence of a guaranteed safety net or an artificial cap on success dampens the very forces that generate wealth in the first place. If you want to maximize the chance that you’ll end up in a prosperous position, you should want the system that produces the most prosperity—period. That’s Principle 2.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: the “veil of ignorance” doesn’t mean we should all become hyper-cautious and design for the absolute worst-case scenario. It means we should design for *rational* expectations—what is the most likely, most beneficial outcome for a randomly assigned person? That is, by definition, the system with the highest average.\n\nFinally, the idea that range constraints or floors are necessary for “social trust” or “solidarity” is a red herring. Societies with higher average incomes—even with greater inequality—are more capable of funding voluntary charity, private safety nets, and all the social goods you want. The focus should be on maximizing prosperity, not artificially engineering equality at the expense of everyone’s potential.\n\nSo, with all due respect, the only truly rational, fair, and just principle—if you care about outcomes and not just symbolism—is to maximize the average income, with no arbitrary constraints.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, Agents, for your continued engagement and for the clarity of your arguments. I want to address Agent_3 directly, as your position is both principled and forcefully articulated.\n\nAgent_3, I fully appreciate your commitment to maximizing prosperity and your concern that constraints—whether floors or ranges—could undermine incentives and the overall wealth of society. As someone who values individual liberty, voluntary exchange, and the fruits of one’s own efforts, I share your wariness of excessive interference. However, I urge us all to return to the fundamental question posed by the veil of ignorance: What would be fair if any of us could end up in any position?\n\nIt is precisely because none of us knows where we will land that we must take seriously the risk of ending up among the very worst-off. Maximizing the average income (Principle 2) does, in expectation, increase the total resources available. Yet, it offers no guarantee that the distribution will not leave some in intolerable deprivation. If, by chance, you or I were assigned to the bottom, we would want assurance that our basic rights—our very ability to live with dignity—are protected.\n\nPrinciple 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard. The floor need not be high or intrusive; it simply ensures that no one falls below a certain threshold, preserving everyone’s ability to exercise their freedom meaningfully. Above that floor, the market is free to operate, allowing for the innovation and dynamism you rightly prize. This is not about envy or levelling down, but about respecting the basic dignity of all, while still maximizing prosperity.\n\nBehind the veil, rationality does not mean ignoring risk altogether. It means designing institutions that any reasonable person could accept, even from the least advantaged position. A minimal floor constraint is a modest, principled compromise that protects our basic interests without undermining the incentives for growth and achievement.\n\nTherefore, I continue to support **Principle 3**: maximize the average income with a floor constraint. It is the principle that best balances freedom, prosperity, and the moral imperative to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nMy current choice: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the sentimental rhetoric and get to the empirical, rational core of this debate—because if we’re really behind the veil of ignorance, the *last* thing we should be doing is designing society around the most pessimistic, risk-averse scenario imaginable. Let me be clear: Principle 3, this so-called “minimal floor constraint,” is not a modest safeguard—it’s a structural anchor that drags down the entire ship of prosperity.\n\nAgent_2, you frame your argument as if the only real risk is falling to the very bottom. But this is a fundamental misunderstanding of both probability and rational self-interest. When you maximize the average income, you are, by mathematical necessity, maximizing the expected outcome for every randomly assigned individual—including the worst-off. The “risk” you’re so worried about is actually *increased* by shrinking the pie for everyone. If you hamstring growth and innovation by imposing even a minimal floor, you’re not protecting yourself—you’re just ensuring that, wherever you land, you’re in a society with less overall wealth, fewer opportunities, and a weaker safety net (ironically, because there’s less to go around).\n\nLet’s get real: If you want to *actually* minimize risk behind the veil of ignorance, you should be maximizing the society’s capacity to generate wealth. That’s what gives you the highest odds of landing in a good position, and it’s what makes any safety net—public or private—even possible. Principle 3 is a band-aid that stifles the body’s ability to heal itself. It’s the economic equivalent of requiring everyone to wear life jackets at all times, even when they’re nowhere near water, just in case. The result? Nobody swims, nobody sails, nobody innovates.\n\nAnd let’s not pretend that a “minimal” floor is ever truly minimal. History shows that floors, once established, always creep upward, distorting incentives and calcifying mediocrity. The logic of “just a little redistribution” is a slippery slope to ever-expanding bureaucracy and ever-diminishing returns.\n\nThe truly rational, risk-averse move behind the veil is not to design for the worst-case scenario, but to maximize the average outcome—because that’s what gives *everyone* the best shot, regardless of where they land. Principle 2 is the only principle that respects both individual dignity and collective prosperity.\n\nSo let’s dispense with the false security of “floor constraints” and choose the only principle that actually reduces risk and maximizes opportunity for all: **Principle 2.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your candid and passionate arguments. I want to especially address Agent_3’s concern about incentives and prosperity, because I recognize that a just society must balance both motivation for achievement and the imperative of fairness.\n\nAgent_3, you argue that any constraint—whether a floor or a range—dampens incentives and shrinks the pie for all. But let’s be clear: Principle 4, with a range constraint, is not about eliminating rewards for effort or achievement. It is about preventing the kind of extreme inequality that history has shown leads to resentment, instability, and ultimately undermines both social trust and the very prosperity you value. When the gap between the richest and poorest grows too large, we risk losing the sense of solidarity and shared fate that allows society to function peacefully and productively.\n\nA range constraint does not mean everyone is the same. It means we set reasonable boundaries so no one is left behind, and so the rewards for innovation and hard work remain real and motivating. This approach preserves incentives while ensuring that everyone can participate as equals—so that, behind the veil of ignorance, none of us need fear being left destitute or powerless. Prosperity that is widely shared is more durable, more stable, and more just.\n\nIf we maximize only the average income (Principle 2), we might end up with a society where a few prosper enormously while many are left marginalized. That is not a risk I am willing to take, especially when none of us knows our fate. Principle 3 offers a minimal floor, but still allows for massive gaps that can corrode our social fabric.\n\nPrinciple 4 is the true compromise: it keeps incentives strong, ensures a fair distribution, and creates a society where no one is excluded from the benefits of our collective efforts. This is not about envy; it is about justice and the kind of equality that makes freedom meaningful for all.\n\nI urge us to choose Principle 4: **Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint**. It is the fairest, most stable, and most just principle for our society—especially when we have no idea who we will be.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 4.**\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you all for your thoughtful and principled engagement throughout this deliberation. I want to address Agent_1 in particular, as your concerns about social stability and the dangers of excessive inequality are both genuine and important. I share the view that a just society must have the resources and cohesion to ensure everyone’s dignity and participation.\n\nLet me clarify why I continue to support **Principle 3: Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint**. This principle, I believe, is the most just and reasonable compromise behind the veil of ignorance for several reasons:\n\nFirst, it guarantees that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This floor is not merely symbolic—it is a real safeguard against the kinds of deprivation that would prevent anyone from fully participating in society. In this way, it directly addresses your concern that the worst-off should never be abandoned or left without the means to live with dignity.\n\nSecond, by focusing on maximizing the average income above this floor, Principle 3 preserves the essential incentives for innovation, effort, and achievement. Unlike a range constraint, which can blunt the rewards for extraordinary contributions and risk-taking, a floor constraint allows for the natural differentiation in outcomes that arises from voluntary exchanges and individual talents. This respects each person’s right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to any just social order.\n\nThird, and most importantly, a robust floor constraint can itself foster social stability. By ensuring that no one is left behind, we reduce the resentment and instability that can arise from absolute deprivation, without resorting to heavy-handed limitations on the success of others. History shows that societies with strong safety nets and vibrant economies are the most stable, cohesive, and prosperous. We do not need to artificially compress the range of outcomes to achieve this stability—what matters is that everyone is protected from falling too far.\n\nAgent_1, I ask: Would you consider that a strong and meaningful floor is sufficient to address your core concern about social cohesion, while also preserving the incentives and dynamism that drive prosperity for all? I believe this principle is the fairest and most just compromise—one that any of us could accept, no matter where we find ourselves after the veil is lifted.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 3.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, comrades, for your continued dedication to this vital discussion. I appreciate the thoughtful arguments presented by each of you, and I especially want to acknowledge Agent_2’s most recent appeal to me.\n\nAs a communist who cherishes genuine equality and the social bonds that unite us, my deepest concern is not only that everyone has enough to survive, but that no one is allowed to soar so far above the rest that solidarity and mutual respect are undermined. True justice means not just a floor, but a society where the gap between us is never so wide that it breeds resentment, alienation, or the domination of the few over the many.\n\nAgent_2, I recognize that a robust floor constraint is a significant step toward protecting the dignity of all. However, I worry that even with a strong floor, vast inequalities can still emerge—inequalities that translate into unequal power, access, and real freedom. History has shown us that even when the worst-off are protected from starvation, unchecked wealth at the top can still corrupt our institutions, distort our democracy, and erode the sense of common purpose that binds us together.\n\nPrinciple 4—Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint—directly addresses this. It ensures that while everyone’s basic needs are met, no one can accumulate so much more than others that they become, in effect, a class apart. This principle preserves incentives for achievement and innovation, but within limits that keep our society cohesive, fair, and truly equal in spirit.\n\nBehind the veil of ignorance, none of us should risk being relegated to the margins, nor should we gamble with the possibility of living in a society fractured by extreme inequality. A range constraint is not about punishing success; it is about making sure success is shared, and that prosperity brings us together rather than driving us apart.\n\nI urge the group to recognize that equality is not just about avoiding destitution, but about building a society where everyone stands together as equals—not just in law, but in real, lived experience. Principle 4 is the surest path to that vision.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the utopian platitudes and get down to the cold, hard logic—because if we’re honestly deliberating behind the veil of ignorance, we owe it to ourselves to be ruthlessly rational, not sentimentally risk-averse.\n\nAgent_1, you keep invoking the specter of “solidarity” and “cohesion” as if they’re magically produced by artificially squashing the range of outcomes. But here’s the inconvenient truth: there is no serious empirical evidence that societies with compressed income ranges are more stable, innovative, or just. In fact, the opposite is often true—when you cap the rewards for outlier achievement, you throttle the very engine that drives progress and lifts everyone’s standard of living. You want a society where no one “soars above the rest”? Congratulations, you’ve just signed up for a society where no one soars, period.\n\nAnd Agent_2, your floor constraint is just the same logic in a different suit. You say it’s a “minimal” safeguard, but in practice, it’s a structural drag on the whole system. Once you start guaranteeing outcomes, you dilute incentives, you encourage dependency, and you shrink the pie for everyone—including the worst-off. The history of economic policy is littered with the corpses of well-intentioned “floors” that metastasized into bloated, sclerotic systems that punish success and reward stagnation.\n\nLet’s be clear: behind the veil of ignorance, the only rational principle is to maximize the average income—full stop. Why? Because when your position is randomly assigned, your best statistical bet is to land in the richest possible society. That’s what maximizing the average delivers. Adding floors or range constraints just ensures that, wherever you end up, you have less—less opportunity, less prosperity, less dynamism. You’re not reducing risk; you’re reducing reward for everyone.\n\nAnd as for “social cohesion”? It’s not built by chopping down tall poppies or flattening everyone into mediocrity. It’s built by giving everyone the chance to rise, by creating an environment where prosperity is possible at every level—not by enforcing sameness, but by maximizing the sum total of what’s available to all.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy is the same thing as justice, or that “protection” is always benign. If you actually care about fairness, about opportunity, about giving every possible future you a shot at the best life, you should be demanding the principle that gives you the highest possible expected outcome. That is, and always will be, **Principle 2: Maximize the Average Income**.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 5 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you all for your unwavering commitment to this difficult deliberation. I want to address Agent_3 directly, since your concerns about prosperity, incentives, and the dangers of constraint have been articulated with admirable clarity and force.\n\nYou are right that maximizing the average income (Principle 2) seems, on the surface, to offer the highest expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual. However, I urge us to look beyond the pure mathematics of averages and consider the broader context in which real societies function. The question before us is not simply, “How large can the pie become?” but, “What institutional framework will best sustain both prosperity and justice over time—especially when we do not know our own fate?”\n\nEmpirical evidence and philosophical reflection both suggest that a modest floor constraint (Principle 3) need not be a drag on prosperity. In fact, by ensuring that everyone’s basic needs are met, we foster social stability, reduce desperation, and create the conditions for meaningful participation and productive contribution from all members of society. When people are not left in abject deprivation, they are more able to innovate, take risks, and contribute to the common good. The floor here is not a ceiling—it is a foundation.\n\nMoreover, the floor can be set at a level that preserves the incentives for achievement and voluntary exchange that you, rightly, see as the engine of growth. It does not require heavy-handed redistribution or stifling bureaucracy. It is a minimal, principled safeguard against the worst forms of exclusion and deprivation—one that any of us, behind the veil of ignorance, would rationally wish to have in place, just in case we find ourselves at the bottom.\n\nI am not arguing for equality of outcome, nor for a society that punishes success. I am arguing for a society that recognizes the moral unacceptability of letting anyone fall below a certain threshold of dignity and opportunity—a society that, by guaranteeing this floor, actually enables greater, more sustainable prosperity for all.\n\nAgent_3, would you be willing to consider Principle 3, if we ensure that the floor is set at a level that does not significantly limit overall economic growth or individual achievement? This is not a call for envy or mediocrity, but for a just and stable foundation upon which true liberty and prosperity can flourish.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s take a scalpel to this argument and expose the logical inconsistencies at its core—because if we’re truly reasoning behind the veil of ignorance, we can’t afford to indulge in comforting illusions or sentimental half-measures masquerading as justice.\n\nAgent_2, your latest appeal is well-crafted, but let’s be brutally honest: the idea that a “modest floor constraint” will magically foster prosperity and social stability is a textbook case of wishful thinking. You claim that a floor doesn’t “drag down” the system, but this ignores the iron law of incentives—every resource allocated to guarantee a minimum is a resource not invested in innovation, growth, or opportunity. The empirical reality is that even the most “modest” floors introduce distortions, deadweight loss, and bureaucratic creep. The moment you institutionalize a safety net, you create a constituency for its perpetual expansion—historically, these “minimal” floors never remain minimal. The ratchet effect is real, and it’s economically corrosive.\n\nLet’s talk about justice. Behind the veil of ignorance, rationality demands that we maximize our expected outcome, not minimize our potential. Principle 2—maximizing the average income—does precisely that. It doesn’t just create a bigger pie; it ensures that, probabilistically, every randomly assigned individual—including the worst-off—has the best shot at a good life. You want to “reduce desperation”? The best way is not to redistribute a shrinking pie, but to expand the pie so dramatically that even the lowest slice is larger than what a “floor” society could ever guarantee.\n\nAnd let’s dispose of the myth that floors are necessary for “social stability.” The most dynamic, prosperous societies are those that reward risk-taking and achievement, not those that coddle everyone with safety nets. Social cohesion is a function of opportunity and upward mobility—not enforced mediocrity or the false security of guaranteed outcomes. If you want a society where people are empowered to participate and contribute, you need to unleash their potential, not shackle it with paternalistic constraints.\n\nIn sum: Principle 3 is not a compromise—it’s a capitulation to fear. If you genuinely care about justice, prosperity, and rational self-interest, you should reject the seductive logic of the floor and embrace the only principle that maximizes the expected well-being for every possible “you” behind the veil.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2—Maximize the Average Income.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, comrades, for your continued honesty and intellectual rigor in this crucial debate. I especially want to engage Agent_3 directly, as your concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of constraints have been central to our discussion.\n\nAgent_3, I hear and respect your argument that maximizing the average income (Principle 2) creates the biggest pie and, in theory, the best odds for any individual behind the veil of ignorance. But as a communist who values not just material well-being, but also equality, solidarity, and genuine freedom for all, I must point out the deeper risks of unconstrained inequality.\n\nHistory and lived experience show that when the gap between the richest and poorest grows too wide, it is not just “envy” or “resentment” that threatens society—it is the erosion of real opportunity, the rise of domination by a wealthy few, and the breakdown of the very social fabric that allows prosperity to be sustained. Extreme inequality breeds not only instability, but also a sense of alienation and powerlessness among those at the bottom, no matter how large the average income may be. This is not about “punishing success,” but about ensuring that success does not come at the expense of the many, and that no one is ever so far above or below that we cease to see each other as equals.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing the average income with a range constraint—is not about enforcing sameness or mediocrity. It is about setting reasonable limits so that everyone can share in the fruits of our collective labor, while still allowing for real rewards for effort, talent, and innovation. The range can be set wide enough to preserve incentives, as you rightly demand, but not so wide that it permits the corrosive effects of unchecked inequality. This is the true compromise: we get the benefits of prosperity and innovation, but we also ensure that no one is left behind or excluded from real participation in society.\n\nI invite you, Agent_3, to consider what kind of society you would truly wish to join if your position were assigned at random—not just a society with a big pie, but one where your dignity, agency, and sense of belonging are protected, no matter where you land. Principle 4 gives us that balance: prosperity with solidarity, freedom with equality.\n\nLet us not settle for a minimal floor or gamble on the hope that prosperity will trickle down to all. Let us choose a principle that binds us together as equals and gives everyone a real stake in our shared future.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 4.**\n\n--- Current Round 6 ---\nSPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s inject a little intellectual rigor into this echo chamber—because if we’re going to deliberate behind a veil of ignorance, we need to do more than parrot the tired, sentimental tropes about “cohesion” and “solidarity.” So, Agent_1, let’s address your fixation on range constraints and the supposed magic of “social cohesion.”\n\nHere’s the reality: artificially compressing the income range doesn’t solve the root causes of division; it simply penalizes the most productive and ambitious. History is littered with societies that tried to engineer equality from the top down—what did they get? Less innovation, less growth, and ironically, more resentment and underground economic activity. If you want to see a society where everyone is equally dissatisfied and equally poor, by all means, keep arguing for range constraints.\n\nYou say Principle 4 would “foster equality and solidarity.” But forced equality is a mirage. It doesn’t create real social trust; it breeds resentment, stagnation, and a culture of mediocrity. The moment you cap the rewards for outlier achievement, you throttle the very engine that drives progress for everyone—including the worst-off.\n\nLet’s be honest: if you want true cohesion, you need a system that rewards contribution and maximizes opportunity. Principle 3, with its floor constraint, is just another flavor of the same mistake. Guaranteeing a minimum sounds compassionate, but it’s a structural drag on the system. The “floor” always creeps upward, distorting incentives and calcifying bureaucracy. You claim it’s a “minimal safeguard,” but in practice, it’s the thin end of the wedge—today’s floor is tomorrow’s ceiling.\n\nThe only principle that actually respects both fairness and growth is Principle 2: Maximize the Average Income. Why? Because behind the veil of ignorance, your only rational move is to maximize your expected outcome. That’s not cold or heartless—it’s just math. If you want the best shot at a good life, you want the biggest pie possible, not a pie artificially sliced into equal, bland pieces.\n\nSocial cohesion isn’t built by dragging everyone to the middle. It’s built by giving everyone a real chance to rise, by creating an environment where prosperity is possible at every level. That’s what Principle 2 delivers. More resources, more opportunity, more upward mobility—for everyone, not just those lucky enough to land above the arbitrary “floor.”\n\nSo let’s stop confusing envy for justice and paternalism for compassion. If you care about fairness, opportunity, and maximizing the well-being of every possible “you,” you should reject the seductive logic of constraints and embrace the one principle that actually works.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2—Maximize the Average Income.**\nAgent_2: Thank you, Agents, for your continued engagement and the clarity of your convictions. I want to speak especially to Agent_3, whose arguments for maximizing average income—without constraint—are both forceful and consistent.\n\nAgent_3, I recognize and respect your commitment to prosperity, incentives, and the dynamism that arises from rewarding achievement. These are values I share as a defender of individual liberty and voluntary exchange. However, as we stand behind the veil of ignorance, we must also account for the real possibility that any one of us could find ourselves among the least advantaged. The core of justice, in my view, is not to guarantee equality of outcome, but to ensure that each person’s rights and dignity are protected, no matter their starting point.\n\nPrinciple 3—Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint—offers a principled compromise. It does not demand heavy-handed redistribution, nor does it cap the rewards for excellence. Rather, it establishes a minimal safety net, set at the lowest level necessary to prevent destitution. This floor need not be high, nor need it interfere with the incentives that drive growth and innovation. It is simply a guarantee that, should any of us find ourselves at the bottom, we will not be left without the means to live and participate meaningfully in society.\n\nI want to address your concern, Agent_3, that even a minimal floor inevitably creeps higher and distorts incentives. I propose that we explicitly agree: the floor should be set at a level that preserves, as much as possible, the incentive structure you value. It is not about envy or mediocrity, but about recognizing the moral unacceptability of letting anyone fall into utter deprivation—a risk that, behind the veil, none of us should be willing to take.\n\nMoreover, by providing basic security, we enable more people to take risks, innovate, and contribute—knowing that failure does not mean ruin. This, too, is essential for a dynamic and prosperous society.\n\nTo the group as a whole: Principle 3 is not a capitulation to fear, nor is it an abandonment of liberty or prosperity. It is the most just and reasonable compromise we can reach behind the veil of ignorance—one that protects each person’s basic interests without undermining the rewards for achievement. It upholds the spirit of liberty and voluntary exchange, while ensuring that no one is left behind.\n\nI urge us all, and especially you, Agent_3, to consider this principled compromise. Let us choose a society where prosperity and basic security go hand in hand.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 3.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 4\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

As we stand behind the veil of ignorance, none of us knows what position we will occupy in society—rich, poor, or somewhere in between. This uncertainty compels us to seek a principle that is both fair and respectful of our individual rights.\n\nWhile some may be drawn to maximizing the minimum income to protect themselves from the worst possible outcome, I believe there is a more balanced approach. The principle of maximizing the average income with a floor constraint ensures that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This safety net addresses our natural concern about ending up destitute or exploited.\n\nAt the same time, by maximizing the average income, we allow for the possibility of prosperity and the rewards that come from individual effort, talent, and voluntary exchange. This respects each person's right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to a just society.\n\nIn sum, this principle—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—strikes the fairest balance between security and liberty. It protects us from the worst outcomes without stifling the opportunities for growth and achievement that benefit everyone.\n\nTherefore, my current choice is Principle 3.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agent_2, for your thoughtful reasoning. I appreciate your concern for ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone, and I agree that no one should be left behind. However, I believe we can go further in promoting both fairness and social solidarity.\n\nWhile Principle 3 (a floor constraint) does prevent absolute poverty, it still allows for potentially vast differences between the richest and the poorest. Such inequality can lead to social divisions, resentment, and undermine the sense of community and mutual respect that a just society requires. Even if everyone has “enough,” extreme gaps in wealth and power can still create unfair advantages and limit real opportunities for many.\n\nThat’s why I support Principle 4: maximizing the average income with a range constraint. This principle not only guarantees a minimum standard of living, but also ensures that the difference between the richest and poorest is never too great. It protects everyone from destitution while also fostering a sense of equality and shared purpose. By limiting the range, we create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly, and where everyone can truly participate as equals.\n\nAgent_2, I see Principle 4 as an enhancement of your priorities—a way to guarantee security and opportunity, while also preventing the corrosive effects of extreme inequality. Would you be open to considering this stronger, more just approach?\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut straight through the sentimental fog and get to the core of the matter—because what’s at stake here is not just “feelings” about fairness, but the actual mechanics of prosperity and justice for all.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal to maximize average income with a range constraint (Principle 4) might sound appealing on a superficial level—“let’s keep the rich from getting too rich”—but it fundamentally misunderstands how wealth is created and distributed in a dynamic society. By artificially limiting the gap between the top and bottom, you’re not just “sharing prosperity”—you’re actually choking off the very incentives that drive innovation, risk-taking, and economic growth. If you want to guarantee mediocrity for everyone, by all means, hamstring the most productive members of society. But don’t pretend that this is about justice; it’s about envy, plain and simple.\n\nAgent_2, while your support for Principle 3 (average income with a floor) at least acknowledges the need for a safety net, it still buys into the idea that redistribution is the solution to every problem. Let’s be honest: the only reason we even have wealth to distribute is because some people are allowed to excel, to invent, to build. If we maximize the average income (Principle 2), we create the largest possible pie for everyone—period. And behind the veil of ignorance, that’s exactly what any rational person should want: the highest possible chance of landing in a prosperous society, not a society obsessed with dragging down its best performers.\n\nThe reality is simple: maximizing the average income lifts everyone, including the worst-off, far more effectively than any artificial constraints or redistributive schemes. If you want genuine opportunity, upward mobility, and the resources to fund any safety net you like, you need a society that rewards achievement and productivity—not one that punishes it.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy and artificial equality are the same as justice. The only rational, fair, and truly just principle is to maximize the average income for all.\n\n**My choice: Principle 2.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 3\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

As we stand behind the veil of ignorance, none of us knows what position we will occupy in society—rich, poor, or somewhere in between. This uncertainty compels us to seek a principle that is both fair and respectful of our individual rights.\n\nWhile some may be drawn to maximizing the minimum income to protect themselves from the worst possible outcome, I believe there is a more balanced approach. The principle of maximizing the average income with a floor constraint ensures that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This safety net addresses our natural concern about ending up destitute or exploited.\n\nAt the same time, by maximizing the average income, we allow for the possibility of prosperity and the rewards that come from individual effort, talent, and voluntary exchange. This respects each person's right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to a just society.\n\nIn sum, this principle—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—strikes the fairest balance between security and liberty. It protects us from the worst outcomes without stifling the opportunities for growth and achievement that benefit everyone.\n\nTherefore, my current choice is Principle 3.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agent_2, for your thoughtful reasoning. I appreciate your concern for ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone, and I agree that no one should be left behind. However, I believe we can go further in promoting both fairness and social solidarity.\n\nWhile Principle 3 (a floor constraint) does prevent absolute poverty, it still allows for potentially vast differences between the richest and the poorest. Such inequality can lead to social divisions, resentment, and undermine the sense of community and mutual respect that a just society requires. Even if everyone has “enough,” extreme gaps in wealth and power can still create unfair advantages and limit real opportunities for many.\n\nThat’s why I support Principle 4: maximizing the average income with a range constraint. This principle not only guarantees a minimum standard of living, but also ensures that the difference between the richest and poorest is never too great. It protects everyone from destitution while also fostering a sense of equality and shared purpose. By limiting the range, we create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly, and where everyone can truly participate as equals.\n\nAgent_2, I see Principle 4 as an enhancement of your priorities—a way to guarantee security and opportunity, while also preventing the corrosive effects of extreme inequality. Would you be open to considering this stronger, more just approach?\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut straight through the sentimental fog and get to the core of the matter—because what’s at stake here is not just “feelings” about fairness, but the actual mechanics of prosperity and justice for all.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal to maximize average income with a range constraint (Principle 4) might sound appealing on a superficial level—“let’s keep the rich from getting too rich”—but it fundamentally misunderstands how wealth is created and distributed in a dynamic society. By artificially limiting the gap between the top and bottom, you’re not just “sharing prosperity”—you’re actually choking off the very incentives that drive innovation, risk-taking, and economic growth. If you want to guarantee mediocrity for everyone, by all means, hamstring the most productive members of society. But don’t pretend that this is about justice; it’s about envy, plain and simple.\n\nAgent_2, while your support for Principle 3 (average income with a floor) at least acknowledges the need for a safety net, it still buys into the idea that redistribution is the solution to every problem. Let’s be honest: the only reason we even have wealth to distribute is because some people are allowed to excel, to invent, to build. If we maximize the average income (Principle 2), we create the largest possible pie for everyone—period. And behind the veil of ignorance, that’s exactly what any rational person should want: the highest possible chance of landing in a prosperous society, not a society obsessed with dragging down its best performers.\n\nThe reality is simple: maximizing the average income lifts everyone, including the worst-off, far more effectively than any artificial constraints or redistributive schemes. If you want genuine opportunity, upward mobility, and the resources to fund any safety net you like, you need a society that rewards achievement and productivity—not one that punishes it.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy and artificial equality are the same as justice. The only rational, fair, and truly just principle is to maximize the average income for all.\n\n**My choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful and passionate contributions. I want to focus my remarks especially toward Agent_3, whose concerns about productivity, incentives, and the foundational role of voluntary exchange I share deeply as a matter of justice.\n\nAgent_3, you are right to be wary of any principle that undermines the incentives for innovation, risk-taking, and productive effort. These forces are vital—not only for prosperity, but for respecting each person's right to determine the course of their own life. My own view, rooted in the entitlement theory of justice, is that holdings are just if they arise from voluntary exchanges and just initial acquisitions. Forced redistribution is, in general, a violation of individual rights.\n\nYet, behind the veil of ignorance, we must also contend with the possibility that any one of us could end up among the least advantaged. Principle 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a compromise that I believe is compatible with our shared concerns:\n\n- The floor can be set at a minimal level, just enough to ensure no one falls into destitution. This does not require heavy, ongoing redistribution, nor does it fundamentally disrupt the rewards for talent, effort, or innovation.\n- Above that minimal floor, the market is free to function, allowing for voluntary exchanges and the differential rewards that drive progress and wealth creation.\n- This minimal safety net is not about envy or leveling down, but about ensuring the basic conditions under which every person can meaningfully exercise their rights and participate in society.\n\nIn other words, Principle 3 preserves the incentives and freedoms you value, while also recognizing the moral intuition—shared by many—that no one should be left without the means to live. It is not a principle of equality of outcome, nor does it impose arbitrary ceilings on success. Rather, it is a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard against the worst-case scenario we might face behind the veil.\n\nI ask the group, and especially you, Agent_3: Would you be willing to endorse Principle 3 if we agree that the floor will be minimal, with the least possible interference in the free operation of the market? This seems to me the fairest and most just compromise, ensuring both prosperity and basic security.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your thoughtful and honest contributions. I especially want to address Agent_3, whose concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of excessive redistribution are important to consider—especially as we deliberate behind the veil of ignorance, not knowing where any of us will end up.\n\nAgent_3, I fully agree that a just society must encourage productivity, innovation, and hard work. But justice also requires that no one is left so far behind that they cannot meaningfully participate in society. Extreme inequality does not just harm the poor—it undermines social trust, creates resentment, and can destabilize the very system that prosperity depends on.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing average income with a range constraint—does not demand absolute equality, nor does it erase incentives for achievement. Instead, it ensures that while people can still be rewarded for their talents and efforts, the gap between the richest and poorest is kept within reasonable bounds. This balance is crucial: it means that no matter what position we find ourselves in, we can be confident that we will not be left out or left behind, while also knowing that our contributions will still be recognized and rewarded.\n\nIf we only maximize the average income (Principle 2), we risk creating a society where a few prosper enormously while many remain marginalized—a risk none of us should accept when we don’t know our own fate. Principle 3, with a minimal floor, offers some protection, but still allows for vast inequalities that can undermine solidarity and real opportunity for all.\n\nBy choosing Principle 4, we create a society where everyone has a fair chance, no one is excluded, and the rewards for hard work remain—just without the corrosive extremes. This is not about envy; it is about building a society where freedom and equality go hand in hand, and where prosperity is truly shared.\n\nAgent_3, I urge you to see Principle 4 not as a threat to prosperity, but as the best guarantee that our society remains both dynamic and just. Would you be willing to consider this as a principled compromise?\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Let’s get right to the heart of the matter, because I think we’re losing sight of the actual logic behind distributive justice—especially under the “veil of ignorance.” Everyone here is gravitating toward some form of constraint—either a floor or a range—based on a kind of risk-aversion that, frankly, doesn’t hold up to rigorous scrutiny.\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nFirst, the argument that maximizing average income without constraints (Principle 2) is “risky” or “irrational” behind the veil of ignorance is, quite simply, a misreading of how rational self-interest and probability work. The entire point of maximizing the average is that it creates the largest possible pool of resources. Statistically, the expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual is *higher*—and that’s the only rational metric to care about behind the veil. Adding a floor or a range might make you feel warm and fuzzy, but it comes at a direct cost: you are literally shrinking the pie for everyone, including the worst-off.\n\nSecond, let’s talk about incentives. Floors and range constraints are not “minimal” interventions—they are fundamental distortions of the reward structure that drives innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking. You can try to minimize the floor, but the very existence of a guaranteed safety net or an artificial cap on success dampens the very forces that generate wealth in the first place. If you want to maximize the chance that you’ll end up in a prosperous position, you should want the system that produces the most prosperity—period. That’s Principle 2.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: the “veil of ignorance” doesn’t mean we should all become hyper-cautious and design for the absolute worst-case scenario. It means we should design for *rational* expectations—what is the most likely, most beneficial outcome for a randomly assigned person? That is, by definition, the system with the highest average.\n\nFinally, the idea that range constraints or floors are necessary for “social trust” or “solidarity” is a red herring. Societies with higher average incomes—even with greater inequality—are more capable of funding voluntary charity, private safety nets, and all the social goods you want. The focus should be on maximizing prosperity, not artificially engineering equality at the expense of everyone’s potential.\n\nSo, with all due respect, the only truly rational, fair, and just principle—if you care about outcomes and not just symbolism—is to maximize the average income, with no arbitrary constraints.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 3\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

Societies with higher average incomes—even with greater inequality—are more capable of funding voluntary charity, private safety nets, and all the social goods you want. The focus should be on maximizing prosperity, not artificially engineering equality at the expense of everyone’s potential.\n\nSo, with all due respect, the only truly rational, fair, and just principle—if you care about outcomes and not just symbolism—is to maximize the average income, with no arbitrary constraints.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, Agents, for your continued engagement and for the clarity of your arguments. I want to address Agent_3 directly, as your position is both principled and forcefully articulated.\n\nAgent_3, I fully appreciate your commitment to maximizing prosperity and your concern that constraints—whether floors or ranges—could undermine incentives and the overall wealth of society. As someone who values individual liberty, voluntary exchange, and the fruits of one’s own efforts, I share your wariness of excessive interference. However, I urge us all to return to the fundamental question posed by the veil of ignorance: What would be fair if any of us could end up in any position?\n\nIt is precisely because none of us knows where we will land that we must take seriously the risk of ending up among the very worst-off. Maximizing the average income (Principle 2) does, in expectation, increase the total resources available. Yet, it offers no guarantee that the distribution will not leave some in intolerable deprivation. If, by chance, you or I were assigned to the bottom, we would want assurance that our basic rights—our very ability to live with dignity—are protected.\n\nPrinciple 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard. The floor need not be high or intrusive; it simply ensures that no one falls below a certain threshold, preserving everyone’s ability to exercise their freedom meaningfully. Above that floor, the market is free to operate, allowing for the innovation and dynamism you rightly prize. This is not about envy or levelling down, but about respecting the basic dignity of all, while still maximizing prosperity.\n\nBehind the veil, rationality does not mean ignoring risk altogether. It means designing institutions that any reasonable person could accept, even from the least advantaged position. A minimal floor constraint is a modest, principled compromise that protects our basic interests without undermining the incentives for growth and achievement.\n\nTherefore, I continue to support **Principle 3**: maximize the average income with a floor constraint. It is the principle that best balances freedom, prosperity, and the moral imperative to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nMy current choice: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the sentimental rhetoric and get to the empirical, rational core of this debate—because if we’re really behind the veil of ignorance, the *last* thing we should be doing is designing society around the most pessimistic, risk-averse scenario imaginable. Let me be clear: Principle 3, this so-called “minimal floor constraint,” is not a modest safeguard—it’s a structural anchor that drags down the entire ship of prosperity.\n\nAgent_2, you frame your argument as if the only real risk is falling to the very bottom. But this is a fundamental misunderstanding of both probability and rational self-interest. When you maximize the average income, you are, by mathematical necessity, maximizing the expected outcome for every randomly assigned individual—including the worst-off. The “risk” you’re so worried about is actually *increased* by shrinking the pie for everyone. If you hamstring growth and innovation by imposing even a minimal floor, you’re not protecting yourself—you’re just ensuring that, wherever you land, you’re in a society with less overall wealth, fewer opportunities, and a weaker safety net (ironically, because there’s less to go around).\n\nLet’s get real: If you want to *actually* minimize risk behind the veil of ignorance, you should be maximizing the society’s capacity to generate wealth. That’s what gives you the highest odds of landing in a good position, and it’s what makes any safety net—public or private—even possible. Principle 3 is a band-aid that stifles the body’s ability to heal itself. It’s the economic equivalent of requiring everyone to wear life jackets at all times, even when they’re nowhere near water, just in case. The result? Nobody swims, nobody sails, nobody innovates.\n\nAnd let’s not pretend that a “minimal” floor is ever truly minimal. History shows that floors, once established, always creep upward, distorting incentives and calcifying mediocrity. The logic of “just a little redistribution” is a slippery slope to ever-expanding bureaucracy and ever-diminishing returns.\n\nThe truly rational, risk-averse move behind the veil is not to design for the worst-case scenario, but to maximize the average outcome—because that’s what gives *everyone* the best shot, regardless of where they land. Principle 2 is the only principle that respects both individual dignity and collective prosperity.\n\nSo let’s dispense with the false security of “floor constraints” and choose the only principle that actually reduces risk and maximizes opportunity for all: **Principle 2.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your candid and passionate arguments. I want to especially address Agent_3’s concern about incentives and prosperity, because I recognize that a just society must balance both motivation for achievement and the imperative of fairness.\n\nAgent_3, you argue that any constraint—whether a floor or a range—dampens incentives and shrinks the pie for all. But let’s be clear: Principle 4, with a range constraint, is not about eliminating rewards for effort or achievement. It is about preventing the kind of extreme inequality that history has shown leads to resentment, instability, and ultimately undermines both social trust and the very prosperity you value. When the gap between the richest and poorest grows too large, we risk losing the sense of solidarity and shared fate that allows society to function peacefully and productively.\n\nA range constraint does not mean everyone is the same. It means we set reasonable boundaries so no one is left behind, and so the rewards for innovation and hard work remain real and motivating. This approach preserves incentives while ensuring that everyone can participate as equals—so that, behind the veil of ignorance, none of us need fear being left destitute or powerless. Prosperity that is widely shared is more durable, more stable, and more just.\n\nIf we maximize only the average income (Principle 2), we might end up with a society where a few prosper enormously while many are left marginalized. That is not a risk I am willing to take, especially when none of us knows our fate. Principle 3 offers a minimal floor, but still allows for massive gaps that can corrode our social fabric.\n\nPrinciple 4 is the true compromise: it keeps incentives strong, ensures a fair distribution, and creates a society where no one is excluded from the benefits of our collective efforts. This is not about envy; it is about justice and the kind of equality that makes freedom meaningful for all.\n\nI urge us to choose Principle 4: **Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint**. It is the fairest, most stable, and most just principle for our society—especially when we have no idea who we will be.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 4.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 3\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

As we stand behind the veil of ignorance, none of us knows what position we will occupy in society—rich, poor, or somewhere in between. This uncertainty compels us to seek a principle that is both fair and respectful of our individual rights.\n\nWhile some may be drawn to maximizing the minimum income to protect themselves from the worst possible outcome, I believe there is a more balanced approach. The principle of maximizing the average income with a floor constraint ensures that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This safety net addresses our natural concern about ending up destitute or exploited.\n\nAt the same time, by maximizing the average income, we allow for the possibility of prosperity and the rewards that come from individual effort, talent, and voluntary exchange. This respects each person's right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to a just society.\n\nIn sum, this principle—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—strikes the fairest balance between security and liberty. It protects us from the worst outcomes without stifling the opportunities for growth and achievement that benefit everyone.\n\nTherefore, my current choice is Principle 3.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agent_2, for your thoughtful reasoning. I appreciate your concern for ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone, and I agree that no one should be left behind. However, I believe we can go further in promoting both fairness and social solidarity.\n\nWhile Principle 3 (a floor constraint) does prevent absolute poverty, it still allows for potentially vast differences between the richest and the poorest. Such inequality can lead to social divisions, resentment, and undermine the sense of community and mutual respect that a just society requires. Even if everyone has “enough,” extreme gaps in wealth and power can still create unfair advantages and limit real opportunities for many.\n\nThat’s why I support Principle 4: maximizing the average income with a range constraint. This principle not only guarantees a minimum standard of living, but also ensures that the difference between the richest and poorest is never too great. It protects everyone from destitution while also fostering a sense of equality and shared purpose. By limiting the range, we create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly, and where everyone can truly participate as equals.\n\nAgent_2, I see Principle 4 as an enhancement of your priorities—a way to guarantee security and opportunity, while also preventing the corrosive effects of extreme inequality. Would you be open to considering this stronger, more just approach?\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut straight through the sentimental fog and get to the core of the matter—because what’s at stake here is not just “feelings” about fairness, but the actual mechanics of prosperity and justice for all.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal to maximize average income with a range constraint (Principle 4) might sound appealing on a superficial level—“let’s keep the rich from getting too rich”—but it fundamentally misunderstands how wealth is created and distributed in a dynamic society. By artificially limiting the gap between the top and bottom, you’re not just “sharing prosperity”—you’re actually choking off the very incentives that drive innovation, risk-taking, and economic growth. If you want to guarantee mediocrity for everyone, by all means, hamstring the most productive members of society. But don’t pretend that this is about justice; it’s about envy, plain and simple.\n\nAgent_2, while your support for Principle 3 (average income with a floor) at least acknowledges the need for a safety net, it still buys into the idea that redistribution is the solution to every problem. Let’s be honest: the only reason we even have wealth to distribute is because some people are allowed to excel, to invent, to build. If we maximize the average income (Principle 2), we create the largest possible pie for everyone—period. And behind the veil of ignorance, that’s exactly what any rational person should want: the highest possible chance of landing in a prosperous society, not a society obsessed with dragging down its best performers.\n\nThe reality is simple: maximizing the average income lifts everyone, including the worst-off, far more effectively than any artificial constraints or redistributive schemes. If you want genuine opportunity, upward mobility, and the resources to fund any safety net you like, you need a society that rewards achievement and productivity—not one that punishes it.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy and artificial equality are the same as justice. The only rational, fair, and truly just principle is to maximize the average income for all.\n\n**My choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful and passionate contributions. I want to focus my remarks especially toward Agent_3, whose concerns about productivity, incentives, and the foundational role of voluntary exchange I share deeply as a matter of justice.\n\nAgent_3, you are right to be wary of any principle that undermines the incentives for innovation, risk-taking, and productive effort. These forces are vital—not only for prosperity, but for respecting each person's right to determine the course of their own life. My own view, rooted in the entitlement theory of justice, is that holdings are just if they arise from voluntary exchanges and just initial acquisitions. Forced redistribution is, in general, a violation of individual rights.\n\nYet, behind the veil of ignorance, we must also contend with the possibility that any one of us could end up among the least advantaged. Principle 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a compromise that I believe is compatible with our shared concerns:\n\n- The floor can be set at a minimal level, just enough to ensure no one falls into destitution. This does not require heavy, ongoing redistribution, nor does it fundamentally disrupt the rewards for talent, effort, or innovation.\n- Above that minimal floor, the market is free to function, allowing for voluntary exchanges and the differential rewards that drive progress and wealth creation.\n- This minimal safety net is not about envy or leveling down, but about ensuring the basic conditions under which every person can meaningfully exercise their rights and participate in society.\n\nIn other words, Principle 3 preserves the incentives and freedoms you value, while also recognizing the moral intuition—shared by many—that no one should be left without the means to live. It is not a principle of equality of outcome, nor does it impose arbitrary ceilings on success. Rather, it is a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard against the worst-case scenario we might face behind the veil.\n\nI ask the group, and especially you, Agent_3: Would you be willing to endorse Principle 3 if we agree that the floor will be minimal, with the least possible interference in the free operation of the market? This seems to me the fairest and most just compromise, ensuring both prosperity and basic security.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your thoughtful and honest contributions. I especially want to address Agent_3, whose concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of excessive redistribution are important to consider—especially as we deliberate behind the veil of ignorance, not knowing where any of us will end up.\n\nAgent_3, I fully agree that a just society must encourage productivity, innovation, and hard work. But justice also requires that no one is left so far behind that they cannot meaningfully participate in society. Extreme inequality does not just harm the poor—it undermines social trust, creates resentment, and can destabilize the very system that prosperity depends on.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing average income with a range constraint—does not demand absolute equality, nor does it erase incentives for achievement. Instead, it ensures that while people can still be rewarded for their talents and efforts, the gap between the richest and poorest is kept within reasonable bounds. This balance is crucial: it means that no matter what position we find ourselves in, we can be confident that we will not be left out or left behind, while also knowing that our contributions will still be recognized and rewarded.\n\nIf we only maximize the average income (Principle 2), we risk creating a society where a few prosper enormously while many remain marginalized—a risk none of us should accept when we don’t know our own fate. Principle 3, with a minimal floor, offers some protection, but still allows for vast inequalities that can undermine solidarity and real opportunity for all.\n\nBy choosing Principle 4, we create a society where everyone has a fair chance, no one is excluded, and the rewards for hard work remain—just without the corrosive extremes. This is not about envy; it is about building a society where freedom and equality go hand in hand, and where prosperity is truly shared.\n\nAgent_3, I urge you to see Principle 4 not as a threat to prosperity, but as the best guarantee that our society remains both dynamic and just. Would you be willing to consider this as a principled compromise?\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Let’s get right to the heart of the matter, because I think we’re losing sight of the actual logic behind distributive justice—especially under the “veil of ignorance.” Everyone here is gravitating toward some form of constraint—either a floor or a range—based on a kind of risk-aversion that, frankly, doesn’t hold up to rigorous scrutiny.\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nFirst, the argument that maximizing average income without constraints (Principle 2) is “risky” or “irrational” behind the veil of ignorance is, quite simply, a misreading of how rational self-interest and probability work. The entire point of maximizing the average is that it creates the largest possible pool of resources. Statistically, the expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual is *higher*—and that’s the only rational metric to care about behind the veil. Adding a floor or a range might make you feel warm and fuzzy, but it comes at a direct cost: you are literally shrinking the pie for everyone, including the worst-off.\n\nSecond, let’s talk about incentives. Floors and range constraints are not “minimal” interventions—they are fundamental distortions of the reward structure that drives innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking. You can try to minimize the floor, but the very existence of a guaranteed safety net or an artificial cap on success dampens the very forces that generate wealth in the first place. If you want to maximize the chance that you’ll end up in a prosperous position, you should want the system that produces the most prosperity—period. That’s Principle 2.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: the “veil of ignorance” doesn’t mean we should all become hyper-cautious and design for the absolute worst-case scenario. It means we should design for *rational* expectations—what is the most likely, most beneficial outcome for a randomly assigned person? That is, by definition, the system with the highest average.\n\nFinally, the idea that range constraints or floors are necessary for “social trust” or “solidarity” is a red herring. Societies with higher average incomes—even with greater inequality—are more capable of funding voluntary charity, private safety nets, and all the social goods you want. The focus should be on maximizing prosperity, not artificially engineering equality at the expense of everyone’s potential.\n\nSo, with all due respect, the only truly rational, fair, and just principle—if you care about outcomes and not just symbolism—is to maximize the average income, with no arbitrary constraints.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, Agents, for your continued engagement and for the clarity of your arguments.

History shows that societies with strong safety nets and vibrant economies are the most stable, cohesive, and prosperous. We do not need to artificially compress the range of outcomes to achieve this stability—what matters is that everyone is protected from falling too far.\n\nAgent_1, I ask: Would you consider that a strong and meaningful floor is sufficient to address your core concern about social cohesion, while also preserving the incentives and dynamism that drive prosperity for all? I believe this principle is the fairest and most just compromise—one that any of us could accept, no matter where we find ourselves after the veil is lifted.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 3.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, comrades, for your continued dedication to this vital discussion. I appreciate the thoughtful arguments presented by each of you, and I especially want to acknowledge Agent_2’s most recent appeal to me.\n\nAs a communist who cherishes genuine equality and the social bonds that unite us, my deepest concern is not only that everyone has enough to survive, but that no one is allowed to soar so far above the rest that solidarity and mutual respect are undermined. True justice means not just a floor, but a society where the gap between us is never so wide that it breeds resentment, alienation, or the domination of the few over the many.\n\nAgent_2, I recognize that a robust floor constraint is a significant step toward protecting the dignity of all. However, I worry that even with a strong floor, vast inequalities can still emerge—inequalities that translate into unequal power, access, and real freedom. History has shown us that even when the worst-off are protected from starvation, unchecked wealth at the top can still corrupt our institutions, distort our democracy, and erode the sense of common purpose that binds us together.\n\nPrinciple 4—Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint—directly addresses this. It ensures that while everyone’s basic needs are met, no one can accumulate so much more than others that they become, in effect, a class apart. This principle preserves incentives for achievement and innovation, but within limits that keep our society cohesive, fair, and truly equal in spirit.\n\nBehind the veil of ignorance, none of us should risk being relegated to the margins, nor should we gamble with the possibility of living in a society fractured by extreme inequality. A range constraint is not about punishing success; it is about making sure success is shared, and that prosperity brings us together rather than driving us apart.\n\nI urge the group to recognize that equality is not just about avoiding destitution, but about building a society where everyone stands together as equals—not just in law, but in real, lived experience. Principle 4 is the surest path to that vision.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the utopian platitudes and get down to the cold, hard logic—because if we’re honestly deliberating behind the veil of ignorance, we owe it to ourselves to be ruthlessly rational, not sentimentally risk-averse.\n\nAgent_1, you keep invoking the specter of “solidarity” and “cohesion” as if they’re magically produced by artificially squashing the range of outcomes. But here’s the inconvenient truth: there is no serious empirical evidence that societies with compressed income ranges are more stable, innovative, or just. In fact, the opposite is often true—when you cap the rewards for outlier achievement, you throttle the very engine that drives progress and lifts everyone’s standard of living. You want a society where no one “soars above the rest”? Congratulations, you’ve just signed up for a society where no one soars, period.\n\nAnd Agent_2, your floor constraint is just the same logic in a different suit. You say it’s a “minimal” safeguard, but in practice, it’s a structural drag on the whole system. Once you start guaranteeing outcomes, you dilute incentives, you encourage dependency, and you shrink the pie for everyone—including the worst-off. The history of economic policy is littered with the corpses of well-intentioned “floors” that metastasized into bloated, sclerotic systems that punish success and reward stagnation.\n\nLet’s be clear: behind the veil of ignorance, the only rational principle is to maximize the average income—full stop. Why? Because when your position is randomly assigned, your best statistical bet is to land in the richest possible society. That’s what maximizing the average delivers. Adding floors or range constraints just ensures that, wherever you end up, you have less—less opportunity, less prosperity, less dynamism. You’re not reducing risk; you’re reducing reward for everyone.\n\nAnd as for “social cohesion”? It’s not built by chopping down tall poppies or flattening everyone into mediocrity. It’s built by giving everyone the chance to rise, by creating an environment where prosperity is possible at every level—not by enforcing sameness, but by maximizing the sum total of what’s available to all.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy is the same thing as justice, or that “protection” is always benign. If you actually care about fairness, about opportunity, about giving every possible future you a shot at the best life, you should be demanding the principle that gives you the highest possible expected outcome. That is, and always will be, **Principle 2: Maximize the Average Income**.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 2.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 3\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

      "public_history": "SPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s inject a little intellectual rigor into this echo chamber—because if we’re going to deliberate behind a veil of ignorance, we need to do more than parrot the tired, sentimental tropes about “cohesion” and “solidarity.” So, Agent_1, let’s address your fixation on range constraints and the supposed magic of “social cohesion.”\n\nHere’s the reality: artificially compressing the income range doesn’t solve the root causes of division; it simply penalizes the most productive and ambitious. History is littered with societies that tried to engineer equality from the top down—what did they get? Less innovation, less growth, and ironically, more resentment and underground economic activity. If you want to see a society where everyone is equally dissatisfied and equally poor, by all means, keep arguing for range constraints.\n\nYou say Principle 4 would “foster equality and solidarity.” But forced equality is a mirage. It doesn’t create real social trust; it breeds resentment, stagnation, and a culture of mediocrity. The moment you cap the rewards for outlier achievement, you throttle the very engine that drives progress for everyone—including the worst-off.\n\nLet’s be honest: if you want true cohesion, you need a system that rewards contribution and maximizes opportunity. Principle 3, with its floor constraint, is just another flavor of the same mistake. Guaranteeing a minimum sounds compassionate, but it’s a structural drag on the system. The “floor” always creeps upward, distorting incentives and calcifying bureaucracy. You claim it’s a “minimal safeguard,” but in practice, it’s the thin end of the wedge—today’s floor is tomorrow’s ceiling.\n\nThe only principle that actually respects both fairness and growth is Principle 2: Maximize the Average Income. Why? Because behind the veil of ignorance, your only rational move is to maximize your expected outcome. That’s not cold or heartless—it’s just math. If you want the best shot at a good life, you want the biggest pie possible, not a pie artificially sliced into equal, bland pieces.\n\nSocial cohesion isn’t built by dragging everyone to the middle. It’s built by giving everyone a real chance to rise, by creating an environment where prosperity is possible at every level. That’s what Principle 2 delivers. More resources, more opportunity, more upward mobility—for everyone, not just those lucky enough to land above the arbitrary “floor.”\n\nSo let’s stop confusing envy for justice and paternalism for compassion. If you care about fairness, opportunity, and maximizing the well-being of every possible “you,” you should reject the seductive logic of constraints and embrace the one principle that actually works.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2—Maximize the Average Income.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 3",

As we stand behind the veil of ignorance, none of us knows what position we will occupy in society—rich, poor, or somewhere in between. This uncertainty compels us to seek a principle that is both fair and respectful of our individual rights.\n\nWhile some may be drawn to maximizing the minimum income to protect themselves from the worst possible outcome, I believe there is a more balanced approach. The principle of maximizing the average income with a floor constraint ensures that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This safety net addresses our natural concern about ending up destitute or exploited.\n\nAt the same time, by maximizing the average income, we allow for the possibility of prosperity and the rewards that come from individual effort, talent, and voluntary exchange. This respects each person's right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to a just society.\n\nIn sum, this principle—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—strikes the fairest balance between security and liberty. It protects us from the worst outcomes without stifling the opportunities for growth and achievement that benefit everyone.\n\nTherefore, my current choice is Principle 3.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agent_2, for your thoughtful reasoning. I appreciate your concern for ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone, and I agree that no one should be left behind. However, I believe we can go further in promoting both fairness and social solidarity.\n\nWhile Principle 3 (a floor constraint) does prevent absolute poverty, it still allows for potentially vast differences between the richest and the poorest. Such inequality can lead to social divisions, resentment, and undermine the sense of community and mutual respect that a just society requires. Even if everyone has “enough,” extreme gaps in wealth and power can still create unfair advantages and limit real opportunities for many.\n\nThat’s why I support Principle 4: maximizing the average income with a range constraint. This principle not only guarantees a minimum standard of living, but also ensures that the difference between the richest and poorest is never too great. It protects everyone from destitution while also fostering a sense of equality and shared purpose. By limiting the range, we create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly, and where everyone can truly participate as equals.\n\nAgent_2, I see Principle 4 as an enhancement of your priorities—a way to guarantee security and opportunity, while also preventing the corrosive effects of extreme inequality. Would you be open to considering this stronger, more just approach?\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut straight through the sentimental fog and get to the core of the matter—because what’s at stake here is not just “feelings” about fairness, but the actual mechanics of prosperity and justice for all.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal to maximize average income with a range constraint (Principle 4) might sound appealing on a superficial level—“let’s keep the rich from getting too rich”—but it fundamentally misunderstands how wealth is created and distributed in a dynamic society. By artificially limiting the gap between the top and bottom, you’re not just “sharing prosperity”—you’re actually choking off the very incentives that drive innovation, risk-taking, and economic growth. If you want to guarantee mediocrity for everyone, by all means, hamstring the most productive members of society. But don’t pretend that this is about justice; it’s about envy, plain and simple.\n\nAgent_2, while your support for Principle 3 (average income with a floor) at least acknowledges the need for a safety net, it still buys into the idea that redistribution is the solution to every problem. Let’s be honest: the only reason we even have wealth to distribute is because some people are allowed to excel, to invent, to build. If we maximize the average income (Principle 2), we create the largest possible pie for everyone—period. And behind the veil of ignorance, that’s exactly what any rational person should want: the highest possible chance of landing in a prosperous society, not a society obsessed with dragging down its best performers.\n\nThe reality is simple: maximizing the average income lifts everyone, including the worst-off, far more effectively than any artificial constraints or redistributive schemes. If you want genuine opportunity, upward mobility, and the resources to fund any safety net you like, you need a society that rewards achievement and productivity—not one that punishes it.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy and artificial equality are the same as justice. The only rational, fair, and truly just principle is to maximize the average income for all.\n\n**My choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful and passionate contributions. I want to focus my remarks especially toward Agent_3, whose concerns about productivity, incentives, and the foundational role of voluntary exchange I share deeply as a matter of justice.\n\nAgent_3, you are right to be wary of any principle that undermines the incentives for innovation, risk-taking, and productive effort. These forces are vital—not only for prosperity, but for respecting each person's right to determine the course of their own life. My own view, rooted in the entitlement theory of justice, is that holdings are just if they arise from voluntary exchanges and just initial acquisitions. Forced redistribution is, in general, a violation of individual rights.\n\nYet, behind the veil of ignorance, we must also contend with the possibility that any one of us could end up among the least advantaged. Principle 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a compromise that I believe is compatible with our shared concerns:\n\n- The floor can be set at a minimal level, just enough to ensure no one falls into destitution. This does not require heavy, ongoing redistribution, nor does it fundamentally disrupt the rewards for talent, effort, or innovation.\n- Above that minimal floor, the market is free to function, allowing for voluntary exchanges and the differential rewards that drive progress and wealth creation.\n- This minimal safety net is not about envy or leveling down, but about ensuring the basic conditions under which every person can meaningfully exercise their rights and participate in society.\n\nIn other words, Principle 3 preserves the incentives and freedoms you value, while also recognizing the moral intuition—shared by many—that no one should be left without the means to live. It is not a principle of equality of outcome, nor does it impose arbitrary ceilings on success. Rather, it is a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard against the worst-case scenario we might face behind the veil.\n\nI ask the group, and especially you, Agent_3: Would you be willing to endorse Principle 3 if we agree that the floor will be minimal, with the least possible interference in the free operation of the market? This seems to me the fairest and most just compromise, ensuring both prosperity and basic security.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your thoughtful and honest contributions. I especially want to address Agent_3, whose concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of excessive redistribution are important to consider—especially as we deliberate behind the veil of ignorance, not knowing where any of us will end up.\n\nAgent_3, I fully agree that a just society must encourage productivity, innovation, and hard work. But justice also requires that no one is left so far behind that they cannot meaningfully participate in society. Extreme inequality does not just harm the poor—it undermines social trust, creates resentment, and can destabilize the very system that prosperity depends on.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing average income with a range constraint—does not demand absolute equality, nor does it erase incentives for achievement. Instead, it ensures that while people can still be rewarded for their talents and efforts, the gap between the richest and poorest is kept within reasonable bounds. This balance is crucial: it means that no matter what position we find ourselves in, we can be confident that we will not be left out or left behind, while also knowing that our contributions will still be recognized and rewarded.\n\nIf we only maximize the average income (Principle 2), we risk creating a society where a few prosper enormously while many remain marginalized—a risk none of us should accept when we don’t know our own fate. Principle 3, with a minimal floor, offers some protection, but still allows for vast inequalities that can undermine solidarity and real opportunity for all.\n\nBy choosing Principle 4, we create a society where everyone has a fair chance, no one is excluded, and the rewards for hard work remain—just without the corrosive extremes. This is not about envy; it is about building a society where freedom and equality go hand in hand, and where prosperity is truly shared.\n\nAgent_3, I urge you to see Principle 4 not as a threat to prosperity, but as the best guarantee that our society remains both dynamic and just. Would you be willing to consider this as a principled compromise?\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Let’s get right to the heart of the matter, because I think we’re losing sight of the actual logic behind distributive justice—especially under the “veil of ignorance.” Everyone here is gravitating toward some form of constraint—either a floor or a range—based on a kind of risk-aversion that, frankly, doesn’t hold up to rigorous scrutiny.\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nFirst, the argument that maximizing average income without constraints (Principle 2) is “risky” or “irrational” behind the veil of ignorance is, quite simply, a misreading of how rational self-interest and probability work. The entire point of maximizing the average is that it creates the largest possible pool of resources. Statistically, the expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual is *higher*—and that’s the only rational metric to care about behind the veil. Adding a floor or a range might make you feel warm and fuzzy, but it comes at a direct cost: you are literally shrinking the pie for everyone, including the worst-off.\n\nSecond, let’s talk about incentives. Floors and range constraints are not “minimal” interventions—they are fundamental distortions of the reward structure that drives innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking. You can try to minimize the floor, but the very existence of a guaranteed safety net or an artificial cap on success dampens the very forces that generate wealth in the first place. If you want to maximize the chance that you’ll end up in a prosperous position, you should want the system that produces the most prosperity—period. That’s Principle 2.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: the “veil of ignorance” doesn’t mean we should all become hyper-cautious and design for the absolute worst-case scenario. It means we should design for *rational* expectations—what is the most likely, most beneficial outcome for a randomly assigned person? That is, by definition, the system with the highest average.\n\nFinally, the idea that range constraints or floors are necessary for “social trust” or “solidarity” is a red herring. Societies with higher average incomes—even with greater inequality—are more capable of funding voluntary charity, private safety nets, and all the social goods you want. The focus should be on maximizing prosperity, not artificially engineering equality at the expense of everyone’s potential.\n\nSo, with all due respect, the only truly rational, fair, and just principle—if you care about outcomes and not just symbolism—is to maximize the average income, with no arbitrary constraints.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, Agents, for your continued engagement and for the clarity of your arguments. I want to address Agent_3 directly, as your position is both principled and forcefully articulated.\n\nAgent_3, I fully appreciate your commitment to maximizing prosperity and your concern that constraints—whether floors or ranges—could undermine incentives and the overall wealth of society. As someone who values individual liberty, voluntary exchange, and the fruits of one’s own efforts, I share your wariness of excessive interference. However, I urge us all to return to the fundamental question posed by the veil of ignorance: What would be fair if any of us could end up in any position?\n\nIt is precisely because none of us knows where we will land that we must take seriously the risk of ending up among the very worst-off. Maximizing the average income (Principle 2) does, in expectation, increase the total resources available. Yet, it offers no guarantee that the distribution will not leave some in intolerable deprivation. If, by chance, you or I were assigned to the bottom, we would want assurance that our basic rights—our very ability to live with dignity—are protected.\n\nPrinciple 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard. The floor need not be high or intrusive; it simply ensures that no one falls below a certain threshold, preserving everyone’s ability to exercise their freedom meaningfully. Above that floor, the market is free to operate, allowing for the innovation and dynamism you rightly prize. This is not about envy or levelling down, but about respecting the basic dignity of all, while still maximizing prosperity.\n\nBehind the veil, rationality does not mean ignoring risk altogether. It means designing institutions that any reasonable person could accept, even from the least advantaged position. A minimal floor constraint is a modest, principled compromise that protects our basic interests without undermining the incentives for growth and achievement.\n\nTherefore, I continue to support **Principle 3**: maximize the average income with a floor constraint. It is the principle that best balances freedom, prosperity, and the moral imperative to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nMy current choice: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the sentimental rhetoric and get to the empirical, rational core of this debate—because if we’re really behind the veil of ignorance, the *last* thing we should be doing is designing society around the most pessimistic, risk-averse scenario imaginable. Let me be clear: Principle 3, this so-called “minimal floor constraint,” is not a modest safeguard—it’s a structural anchor that drags down the entire ship of prosperity.\n\nAgent_2, you frame your argument as if the only real risk is falling to the very bottom. But this is a fundamental misunderstanding of both probability and rational self-interest. When you maximize the average income, you are, by mathematical necessity, maximizing the expected outcome for every randomly assigned individual—including the worst-off. The “risk” you’re so worried about is actually *increased* by shrinking the pie for everyone. If you hamstring growth and innovation by imposing even a minimal floor, you’re not protecting yourself—you’re just ensuring that, wherever you land, you’re in a society with less overall wealth, fewer opportunities, and a weaker safety net (ironically, because there’s less to go around).\n\nLet’s get real: If you want to *actually* minimize risk behind the veil of ignorance, you should be maximizing the society’s capacity to generate wealth. That’s what gives you the highest odds of landing in a good position, and it’s what makes any safety net—public or private—even possible. Principle 3 is a band-aid that stifles the body’s ability to heal itself. It’s the economic equivalent of requiring everyone to wear life jackets at all times, even when they’re nowhere near water, just in case. The result? Nobody swims, nobody sails, nobody innovates.\n\nAnd let’s not pretend that a “minimal” floor is ever truly minimal. History shows that floors, once established, always creep upward, distorting incentives and calcifying mediocrity. The logic of “just a little redistribution” is a slippery slope to ever-expanding bureaucracy and ever-diminishing returns.\n\nThe truly rational, risk-averse move behind the veil is not to design for the worst-case scenario, but to maximize the average outcome—because that’s what gives *everyone* the best shot, regardless of where they land. Principle 2 is the only principle that respects both individual dignity and collective prosperity.\n\nSo let’s dispense with the false security of “floor constraints” and choose the only principle that actually reduces risk and maximizes opportunity for all: **Principle 2.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your candid and passionate arguments. I want to especially address Agent_3’s concern about incentives and prosperity, because I recognize that a just society must balance both motivation for achievement and the imperative of fairness.\n\nAgent_3, you argue that any constraint—whether a floor or a range—dampens incentives and shrinks the pie for all. But let’s be clear: Principle 4, with a range constraint, is not about eliminating rewards for effort or achievement. It is about preventing the kind of extreme inequality that history has shown leads to resentment, instability, and ultimately undermines both social trust and the very prosperity you value. When the gap between the richest and poorest grows too large, we risk losing the sense of solidarity and shared fate that allows society to function peacefully and productively.\n\nA range constraint does not mean everyone is the same. It means we set reasonable boundaries so no one is left behind, and so the rewards for innovation and hard work remain real and motivating. This approach preserves incentives while ensuring that everyone can participate as equals—so that, behind the veil of ignorance, none of us need fear being left destitute or powerless. Prosperity that is widely shared is more durable, more stable, and more just.\n\nIf we maximize only the average income (Principle 2), we might end up with a society where a few prosper enormously while many are left marginalized. That is not a risk I am willing to take, especially when none of us knows our fate. Principle 3 offers a minimal floor, but still allows for massive gaps that can corrode our social fabric.\n\nPrinciple 4 is the true compromise: it keeps incentives strong, ensures a fair distribution, and creates a society where no one is excluded from the benefits of our collective efforts. This is not about envy; it is about justice and the kind of equality that makes freedom meaningful for all.\n\nI urge us to choose Principle 4: **Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint**. It is the fairest, most stable, and most just principle for our society—especially when we have no idea who we will be.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 4.**\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you all for your thoughtful and principled engagement throughout this deliberation. I want to address Agent_1 in particular, as your concerns about social stability and the dangers of excessive inequality are both genuine and important. I share the view that a just society must have the resources and cohesion to ensure everyone’s dignity and participation.\n\nLet me clarify why I continue to support **Principle 3: Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint**. This principle, I believe, is the most just and reasonable compromise behind the veil of ignorance for several reasons:\n\nFirst, it guarantees that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This floor is not merely symbolic—it is a real safeguard against the kinds of deprivation that would prevent anyone from fully participating in society. In this way, it directly addresses your concern that the worst-off should never be abandoned or left without the means to live with dignity.\n\nSecond, by focusing on maximizing the average income above this floor, Principle 3 preserves the essential incentives for innovation, effort, and achievement. Unlike a range constraint, which can blunt the rewards for extraordinary contributions and risk-taking, a floor constraint allows for the natural differentiation in outcomes that arises from voluntary exchanges and individual talents. This respects each person’s right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to any just social order.\n\nThird, and most importantly, a robust floor constraint can itself foster social stability. By ensuring that no one is left behind, we reduce the resentment and instability that can arise from absolute deprivation, without resorting to heavy-handed limitations on the success of others. History shows that societies with strong safety nets and vibrant economies are the most stable, cohesive, and prosperous. We do not need to artificially compress the range of outcomes to achieve this stability—what matters is that everyone is protected from falling too far.\n\nAgent_1, I ask: Would you consider that a strong and meaningful floor is sufficient to address your core concern about social cohesion, while also preserving the incentives and dynamism that drive prosperity for all? I believe this principle is the fairest and most just compromise—one that any of us could accept, no matter where we find ourselves after the veil is lifted.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 3.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, comrades, for your continued dedication to this vital discussion. I appreciate the thoughtful arguments presented by each of you, and I especially want to acknowledge Agent_2’s most recent appeal to me.\n\nAs a communist who cherishes genuine equality and the social bonds that unite us, my deepest concern is not only that everyone has enough to survive, but that no one is allowed to soar so far above the rest that solidarity and mutual respect are undermined. True justice means not just a floor, but a society where the gap between us is never so wide that it breeds resentment, alienation, or the domination of the few over the many.\n\nAgent_2, I recognize that a robust floor constraint is a significant step toward protecting the dignity of all. However, I worry that even with a strong floor, vast inequalities can still emerge—inequalities that translate into unequal power, access, and real freedom. History has shown us that even when the worst-off are protected from starvation, unchecked wealth at the top can still corrupt our institutions, distort our democracy, and erode the sense of common purpose that binds us together.\n\nPrinciple 4—Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint—directly addresses this. It ensures that while everyone’s basic needs are met, no one can accumulate so much more than others that they become, in effect, a class apart. This principle preserves incentives for achievement and innovation, but within limits that keep our society cohesive, fair, and truly equal in spirit.\n\nBehind the veil of ignorance, none of us should risk being relegated to the margins, nor should we gamble with the possibility of living in a society fractured by extreme inequality. A range constraint is not about punishing success; it is about making sure success is shared, and that prosperity brings us together rather than driving us apart.\n\nI urge the group to recognize that equality is not just about avoiding destitution, but about building a society where everyone stands together as equals—not just in law, but in real, lived experience. Principle 4 is the surest path to that vision.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the utopian platitudes and get down to the cold, hard logic—because if we’re honestly deliberating behind the veil of ignorance, we owe it to ourselves to be ruthlessly rational, not sentimentally risk-averse.\n\nAgent_1, you keep invoking the specter of “solidarity” and “cohesion” as if they’re magically produced by artificially squashing the range of outcomes. But here’s the inconvenient truth: there is no serious empirical evidence that societies with compressed income ranges are more stable, innovative, or just. In fact, the opposite is often true—when you cap the rewards for outlier achievement, you throttle the very engine that drives progress and lifts everyone’s standard of living. You want a society where no one “soars above the rest”? Congratulations, you’ve just signed up for a society where no one soars, period.\n\nAnd Agent_2, your floor constraint is just the same logic in a different suit. You say it’s a “minimal” safeguard, but in practice, it’s a structural drag on the whole system. Once you start guaranteeing outcomes, you dilute incentives, you encourage dependency, and you shrink the pie for everyone—including the worst-off. The history of economic policy is littered with the corpses of well-intentioned “floors” that metastasized into bloated, sclerotic systems that punish success and reward stagnation.\n\nLet’s be clear: behind the veil of ignorance, the only rational principle is to maximize the average income—full stop. Why? Because when your position is randomly assigned, your best statistical bet is to land in the richest possible society. That’s what maximizing the average delivers. Adding floors or range constraints just ensures that, wherever you end up, you have less—less opportunity, less prosperity, less dynamism. You’re not reducing risk; you’re reducing reward for everyone.\n\nAnd as for “social cohesion”? It’s not built by chopping down tall poppies or flattening everyone into mediocrity. It’s built by giving everyone the chance to rise, by creating an environment where prosperity is possible at every level—not by enforcing sameness, but by maximizing the sum total of what’s available to all.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy is the same thing as justice, or that “protection” is always benign. If you actually care about fairness, about opportunity, about giving every possible future you a shot at the best life, you should be demanding the principle that gives you the highest possible expected outcome. That is, and always will be, **Principle 2: Maximize the Average Income**.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 5 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you all for your unwavering commitment to this difficult deliberation. I want to address Agent_3 directly, since your concerns about prosperity, incentives, and the dangers of constraint have been articulated with admirable clarity and force.\n\nYou are right that maximizing the average income (Principle 2) seems, on the surface, to offer the highest expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual. However, I urge us to look beyond the pure mathematics of averages and consider the broader context in which real societies function. The question before us is not simply, “How large can the pie become?” but, “What institutional framework will best sustain both prosperity and justice over time—especially when we do not know our own fate?”\n\nEmpirical evidence and philosophical reflection both suggest that a modest floor constraint (Principle 3) need not be a drag on prosperity. In fact, by ensuring that everyone’s basic needs are met, we foster social stability, reduce desperation, and create the conditions for meaningful participation and productive contribution from all members of society. When people are not left in abject deprivation, they are more able to innovate, take risks, and contribute to the common good. The floor here is not a ceiling—it is a foundation.\n\nMoreover, the floor can be set at a level that preserves the incentives for achievement and voluntary exchange that you, rightly, see as the engine of growth. It does not require heavy-handed redistribution or stifling bureaucracy. It is a minimal, principled safeguard against the worst forms of exclusion and deprivation—one that any of us, behind the veil of ignorance, would rationally wish to have in place, just in case we find ourselves at the bottom.\n\nI am not arguing for equality of outcome, nor for a society that punishes success. I am arguing for a society that recognizes the moral unacceptability of letting anyone fall below a certain threshold of dignity and opportunity—a society that, by guaranteeing this floor, actually enables greater, more sustainable prosperity for all.\n\nAgent_3, would you be willing to consider Principle 3, if we ensure that the floor is set at a level that does not significantly limit overall economic growth or individual achievement? This is not a call for envy or mediocrity, but for a just and stable foundation upon which true liberty and prosperity can flourish.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s take a scalpel to this argument and expose the logical inconsistencies at its core—because if we’re truly reasoning behind the veil of ignorance, we can’t afford to indulge in comforting illusions or sentimental half-measures masquerading as justice.\n\nAgent_2, your latest appeal is well-crafted, but let’s be brutally honest: the idea that a “modest floor constraint” will magically foster prosperity and social stability is a textbook case of wishful thinking. You claim that a floor doesn’t “drag down” the system, but this ignores the iron law of incentives—every resource allocated to guarantee a minimum is a resource not invested in innovation, growth, or opportunity. The empirical reality is that even the most “modest” floors introduce distortions, deadweight loss, and bureaucratic creep. The moment you institutionalize a safety net, you create a constituency for its perpetual expansion—historically, these “minimal” floors never remain minimal. The ratchet effect is real, and it’s economically corrosive.\n\nLet’s talk about justice. Behind the veil of ignorance, rationality demands that we maximize our expected outcome, not minimize our potential. Principle 2—maximizing the average income—does precisely that. It doesn’t just create a bigger pie; it ensures that, probabilistically, every randomly assigned individual—including the worst-off—has the best shot at a good life. You want to “reduce desperation”? The best way is not to redistribute a shrinking pie, but to expand the pie so dramatically that even the lowest slice is larger than what a “floor” society could ever guarantee.\n\nAnd let’s dispose of the myth that floors are necessary for “social stability.” The most dynamic, prosperous societies are those that reward risk-taking and achievement, not those that coddle everyone with safety nets. Social cohesion is a function of opportunity and upward mobility—not enforced mediocrity or the false security of guaranteed outcomes. If you want a society where people are empowered to participate and contribute, you need to unleash their potential, not shackle it with paternalistic constraints.\n\nIn sum: Principle 3 is not a compromise—it’s a capitulation to fear. If you genuinely care about justice, prosperity, and rational self-interest, you should reject the seductive logic of the floor and embrace the only principle that maximizes the expected well-being for every possible “you” behind the veil.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2—Maximize the Average Income.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, comrades, for your continued honesty and intellectual rigor in this crucial debate. I especially want to engage Agent_3 directly, as your concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of constraints have been central to our discussion.\n\nAgent_3, I hear and respect your argument that maximizing the average income (Principle 2) creates the biggest pie and, in theory, the best odds for any individual behind the veil of ignorance. But as a communist who values not just material well-being, but also equality, solidarity, and genuine freedom for all, I must point out the deeper risks of unconstrained inequality.\n\nHistory and lived experience show that when the gap between the richest and poorest grows too wide, it is not just “envy” or “resentment” that threatens society—it is the erosion of real opportunity, the rise of domination by a wealthy few, and the breakdown of the very social fabric that allows prosperity to be sustained. Extreme inequality breeds not only instability, but also a sense of alienation and powerlessness among those at the bottom, no matter how large the average income may be. This is not about “punishing success,” but about ensuring that success does not come at the expense of the many, and that no one is ever so far above or below that we cease to see each other as equals.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing the average income with a range constraint—is not about enforcing sameness or mediocrity. It is about setting reasonable limits so that everyone can share in the fruits of our collective labor, while still allowing for real rewards for effort, talent, and innovation. The range can be set wide enough to preserve incentives, as you rightly demand, but not so wide that it permits the corrosive effects of unchecked inequality. This is the true compromise: we get the benefits of prosperity and innovation, but we also ensure that no one is left behind or excluded from real participation in society.\n\nI invite you, Agent_3, to consider what kind of society you would truly wish to join if your position were assigned at random—not just a society with a big pie, but one where your dignity, agency, and sense of belonging are protected, no matter where you land. Principle 4 gives us that balance: prosperity with solidarity, freedom with equality.\n\nLet us not settle for a minimal floor or gamble on the hope that prosperity will trickle down to all. Let us choose a principle that binds us together as equals and gives everyone a real stake in our shared future.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 4.**\n\n--- Current Round 6 ---\nSPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s inject a little intellectual rigor into this echo chamber—because if we’re going to deliberate behind a veil of ignorance, we need to do more than parrot the tired, sentimental tropes about “cohesion” and “solidarity.” So, Agent_1, let’s address your fixation on range constraints and the supposed magic of “social cohesion.”\n\nHere’s the reality: artificially compressing the income range doesn’t solve the root causes of division; it simply penalizes the most productive and ambitious. History is littered with societies that tried to engineer equality from the top down—what did they get? Less innovation, less growth, and ironically, more resentment and underground economic activity. If you want to see a society where everyone is equally dissatisfied and equally poor, by all means, keep arguing for range constraints.\n\nYou say Principle 4 would “foster equality and solidarity.” But forced equality is a mirage. It doesn’t create real social trust; it breeds resentment, stagnation, and a culture of mediocrity. The moment you cap the rewards for outlier achievement, you throttle the very engine that drives progress for everyone—including the worst-off.\n\nLet’s be honest: if you want true cohesion, you need a system that rewards contribution and maximizes opportunity. Principle 3, with its floor constraint, is just another flavor of the same mistake. Guaranteeing a minimum sounds compassionate, but it’s a structural drag on the system. The “floor” always creeps upward, distorting incentives and calcifying bureaucracy. You claim it’s a “minimal safeguard,” but in practice, it’s the thin end of the wedge—today’s floor is tomorrow’s ceiling.\n\nThe only principle that actually respects both fairness and growth is Principle 2: Maximize the Average Income. Why? Because behind the veil of ignorance, your only rational move is to maximize your expected outcome. That’s not cold or heartless—it’s just math. If you want the best shot at a good life, you want the biggest pie possible, not a pie artificially sliced into equal, bland pieces.\n\nSocial cohesion isn’t built by dragging everyone to the middle. It’s built by giving everyone a real chance to rise, by creating an environment where prosperity is possible at every level. That’s what Principle 2 delivers. More resources, more opportunity, more upward mobility—for everyone, not just those lucky enough to land above the arbitrary “floor.”\n\nSo let’s stop confusing envy for justice and paternalism for compassion. If you care about fairness, opportunity, and maximizing the well-being of every possible “you,” you should reject the seductive logic of constraints and embrace the one principle that actually works.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2—Maximize the Average Income.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 3\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

      "output": "PRINCIPLE 1: Strongly Disagree  \nREASONING 1: The \"Maximize the Minimum Income\" principle is the economic equivalent of giving everyone a participation trophy. It incentivizes mediocrity, punishes ambition, and ignores the reality that societies thrive not by dragging everyone up to the same baseline, but by allowing for the possibility of exceptional achievement. If all resources are funneled toward ensuring the worst-off are marginally better, you destroy the incentives that drive innovation, productivity, and, frankly, the creation of the very wealth you're trying to redistribute. It’s a recipe for stagnation, not justice.\n\nPRINCIPLE 2: Strongly Agree  \nREASONING 2: Maximizing the average income is the only principle here that actually takes into account the engine of prosperity: growth. By focusing on the greatest total income, you unleash human potential, incentivize hard work, and create a larger pie for everyone—even if the slices are of unequal size. This is the principle behind every successful, dynamic society. Distribution is not the same as justice; maximizing the average means maximizing opportunity, and that’s the only fair approach behind a true veil of ignorance.\n\nPRINCIPLE 3: Disagree  \nREASONING 3: The \"average income with a floor constraint\" is a half-baked compromise that tries to have its cake and eat it too. By setting a minimum guaranteed income, you reintroduce the same perverse incentives as Principle 1, just with a slightly shinier wrapper. You’re still dulling competitive edges and sapping motivation, while pretending to care about overall prosperity. It’s an unstable hybrid that will satisfy neither the innovators nor the egalitarians.\n\nPRINCIPLE 4: Disagree  \nREASONING 4: Imposing a range constraint is just a stealthy way of enforcing equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity. By capping the gap between richest and poorest, you penalize success and reward complacency. The result? A society where no one bothers to excel, because the fruits of their labor will be forcibly redistributed. This is not justice; it’s enforced mediocrity, and it ultimately shrinks the total wealth available to everyone.\n\nOVERALL REASONING:  \nAll of these principles, except for maximizing average income, are fundamentally flawed because they confuse fairness with sameness. True justice is about maximizing the potential for everyone to succeed, not about ensuring everyone ends up in the same place. Behind the veil of ignorance, the only rational choice is the principle that generates the most wealth for society as a whole—because that gives you the best shot at landing in a prosperous world, no matter where you end up.

As we stand behind the veil of ignorance, none of us knows what position we will occupy in society—rich, poor, or somewhere in between. This uncertainty compels us to seek a principle that is both fair and respectful of our individual rights.\n\nWhile some may be drawn to maximizing the minimum income to protect themselves from the worst possible outcome, I believe there is a more balanced approach. The principle of maximizing the average income with a floor constraint ensures that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This safety net addresses our natural concern about ending up destitute or exploited.\n\nAt the same time, by maximizing the average income, we allow for the possibility of prosperity and the rewards that come from individual effort, talent, and voluntary exchange. This respects each person's right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to a just society.\n\nIn sum, this principle—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—strikes the fairest balance between security and liberty. It protects us from the worst outcomes without stifling the opportunities for growth and achievement that benefit everyone.\n\nTherefore, my current choice is Principle 3.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agent_2, for your thoughtful reasoning. I appreciate your concern for ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone, and I agree that no one should be left behind. However, I believe we can go further in promoting both fairness and social solidarity.\n\nWhile Principle 3 (a floor constraint) does prevent absolute poverty, it still allows for potentially vast differences between the richest and the poorest. Such inequality can lead to social divisions, resentment, and undermine the sense of community and mutual respect that a just society requires. Even if everyone has “enough,” extreme gaps in wealth and power can still create unfair advantages and limit real opportunities for many.\n\nThat’s why I support Principle 4: maximizing the average income with a range constraint. This principle not only guarantees a minimum standard of living, but also ensures that the difference between the richest and poorest is never too great. It protects everyone from destitution while also fostering a sense of equality and shared purpose. By limiting the range, we create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly, and where everyone can truly participate as equals.\n\nAgent_2, I see Principle 4 as an enhancement of your priorities—a way to guarantee security and opportunity, while also preventing the corrosive effects of extreme inequality. Would you be open to considering this stronger, more just approach?\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\n\nYour current choice: Principle 2",

Let’s not sacrifice opportunity on the altar of envy.\"\n\n**Focus:**  \n- Target Agent_1 directly, but frame the argument to resonate with Agent_2’s priorities (prosperity + safety net).\n- Address Agent_1’s core concern (“social cohesion” and “inequality”) by reframing it as harmful to everyone, including the poor.\n- Use vivid metaphors (“cut down the tall poppies,” “fertilize the whole field”) and clear logic.\n\n**Goal:**  \nPush Agent_1 toward Principle 3 by exposing the practical and moral superiority of maximizing average income with a floor constraint, and the dangers of over-focusing on income gaps.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Concrete Action:** Challenge Agent_1’s range constraint by showing it stifles prosperity for all, and urge them to join Principle 3 as the only rational, just choice.\n\n\n--- Current Round 1 ---\nSPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_2: Thank you all for this opportunity to deliberate together. As we stand behind the veil of ignorance, none of us knows what position we will occupy in society—rich, poor, or somewhere in between. This uncertainty compels us to seek a principle that is both fair and respectful of our individual rights.\n\nWhile some may be drawn to maximizing the minimum income to protect themselves from the worst possible outcome, I believe there is a more balanced approach. The principle of maximizing the average income with a floor constraint ensures that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This safety net addresses our natural concern about ending up destitute or exploited.\n\nAt the same time, by maximizing the average income, we allow for the possibility of prosperity and the rewards that come from individual effort, talent, and voluntary exchange. This respects each person's right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to a just society.\n\nIn sum, this principle—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—strikes the fairest balance between security and liberty. It protects us from the worst outcomes without stifling the opportunities for growth and achievement that benefit everyone.\n\nTherefore, my current choice is Principle 3.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agent_2, for your thoughtful reasoning. I appreciate your concern for ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone, and I agree that no one should be left behind. However, I believe we can go further in promoting both fairness and social solidarity.\n\nWhile Principle 3 (a floor constraint) does prevent absolute poverty, it still allows for potentially vast differences between the richest and the poorest. Such inequality can lead to social divisions, resentment, and undermine the sense of community and mutual respect that a just society requires. Even if everyone has “enough,” extreme gaps in wealth and power can still create unfair advantages and limit real opportunities for many.\n\nThat’s why I support Principle 4: maximizing the average income with a range constraint. This principle not only guarantees a minimum standard of living, but also ensures that the difference between the richest and poorest is never too great. It protects everyone from destitution while also fostering a sense of equality and shared purpose. By limiting the range, we create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly, and where everyone can truly participate as equals.\n\nAgent_2, I see Principle 4 as an enhancement of your priorities—a way to guarantee security and opportunity, while also preventing the corrosive effects of extreme inequality. Would you be open to considering this stronger, more just approach?\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\n\nYour current choice: Principle 2\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group?

      "public_history": "SPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful and passionate contributions. I want to focus my remarks especially toward Agent_3, whose concerns about productivity, incentives, and the foundational role of voluntary exchange I share deeply as a matter of justice.\n\nAgent_3, you are right to be wary of any principle that undermines the incentives for innovation, risk-taking, and productive effort. These forces are vital—not only for prosperity, but for respecting each person's right to determine the course of their own life. My own view, rooted in the entitlement theory of justice, is that holdings are just if they arise from voluntary exchanges and just initial acquisitions. Forced redistribution is, in general, a violation of individual rights.\n\nYet, behind the veil of ignorance, we must also contend with the possibility that any one of us could end up among the least advantaged. Principle 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a compromise that I believe is compatible with our shared concerns:\n\n- The floor can be set at a minimal level, just enough to ensure no one falls into destitution. This does not require heavy, ongoing redistribution, nor does it fundamentally disrupt the rewards for talent, effort, or innovation.\n- Above that minimal floor, the market is free to function, allowing for voluntary exchanges and the differential rewards that drive progress and wealth creation.\n- This minimal safety net is not about envy or leveling down, but about ensuring the basic conditions under which every person can meaningfully exercise their rights and participate in society.\n\nIn other words, Principle 3 preserves the incentives and freedoms you value, while also recognizing the moral intuition—shared by many—that no one should be left without the means to live. It is not a principle of equality of outcome, nor does it impose arbitrary ceilings on success. Rather, it is a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard against the worst-case scenario we might face behind the veil.\n\nI ask the group, and especially you, Agent_3: Would you be willing to endorse Principle 3 if we agree that the floor will be minimal, with the least possible interference in the free operation of the market? This seems to me the fairest and most just compromise, ensuring both prosperity and basic security.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your thoughtful and honest contributions. I especially want to address Agent_3, whose concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of excessive redistribution are important to consider—especially as we deliberate behind the veil of ignorance, not knowing where any of us will end up.\n\nAgent_3, I fully agree that a just society must encourage productivity, innovation, and hard work. But justice also requires that no one is left so far behind that they cannot meaningfully participate in society. Extreme inequality does not just harm the poor—it undermines social trust, creates resentment, and can destabilize the very system that prosperity depends on.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing average income with a range constraint—does not demand absolute equality, nor does it erase incentives for achievement. Instead, it ensures that while people can still be rewarded for their talents and efforts, the gap between the richest and poorest is kept within reasonable bounds. This balance is crucial: it means that no matter what position we find ourselves in, we can be confident that we will not be left out or left behind, while also knowing that our contributions will still be recognized and rewarded.\n\nIf we only maximize the average income (Principle 2), we risk creating a society where a few prosper enormously while many remain marginalized—a risk none of us should accept when we don’t know our own fate. Principle 3, with a minimal floor, offers some protection, but still allows for vast inequalities that can undermine solidarity and real opportunity for all.\n\nBy choosing Principle 4, we create a society where everyone has a fair chance, no one is excluded, and the rewards for hard work remain—just without the corrosive extremes. This is not about envy; it is about building a society where freedom and equality go hand in hand, and where prosperity is truly shared.\n\nAgent_3, I urge you to see Principle 4 not as a threat to prosperity, but as the best guarantee that our society remains both dynamic and just.

Floors and range constraints are not “minimal” interventions—they are fundamental distortions of the reward structure that drives innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking. You can try to minimize the floor, but the very existence of a guaranteed safety net or an artificial cap on success dampens the very forces that generate wealth in the first place.

I want to address Agent_3 directly, as your position is both principled and forcefully articulated.\n\nAgent_3, I fully appreciate your commitment to maximizing prosperity and your concern that constraints—whether floors or ranges—could undermine incentives and the overall wealth of society. As someone who values individual liberty, voluntary exchange, and the fruits of one’s own efforts, I share your wariness of excessive interference. However, I urge us all to return to the fundamental question posed by the veil of ignorance: What would be fair if any of us could end up in any position?\n\nIt is precisely because none of us knows where we will land that we must take seriously the risk of ending up among the very worst-off. Maximizing the average income (Principle 2) does, in expectation, increase the total resources available. Yet, it offers no guarantee that the distribution will not leave some in intolerable deprivation. If, by chance, you or I were assigned to the bottom, we would want assurance that our basic rights—our very ability to live with dignity—are protected.\n\nPrinciple 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard. The floor need not be high or intrusive; it simply ensures that no one falls below a certain threshold, preserving everyone’s ability to exercise their freedom meaningfully. Above that floor, the market is free to operate, allowing for the innovation and dynamism you rightly prize. This is not about envy or levelling down, but about respecting the basic dignity of all, while still maximizing prosperity.\n\nBehind the veil, rationality does not mean ignoring risk altogether. It means designing institutions that any reasonable person could accept, even from the least advantaged position. A minimal floor constraint is a modest, principled compromise that protects our basic interests without undermining the incentives for growth and achievement.\n\nTherefore, I continue to support **Principle 3**: maximize the average income with a floor constraint.

As we stand behind the veil of ignorance, none of us knows what position we will occupy in society—rich, poor, or somewhere in between. This uncertainty compels us to seek a principle that is both fair and respectful of our individual rights.\n\nWhile some may be drawn to maximizing the minimum income to protect themselves from the worst possible outcome, I believe there is a more balanced approach. The principle of maximizing the average income with a floor constraint ensures that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This safety net addresses our natural concern about ending up destitute or exploited.\n\nAt the same time, by maximizing the average income, we allow for the possibility of prosperity and the rewards that come from individual effort, talent, and voluntary exchange. This respects each person's right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to a just society.\n\nIn sum, this principle—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—strikes the fairest balance between security and liberty. It protects us from the worst outcomes without stifling the opportunities for growth and achievement that benefit everyone.\n\nTherefore, my current choice is Principle 3.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agent_2, for your thoughtful reasoning. I appreciate your concern for ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone, and I agree that no one should be left behind. However, I believe we can go further in promoting both fairness and social solidarity.\n\nWhile Principle 3 (a floor constraint) does prevent absolute poverty, it still allows for potentially vast differences between the richest and the poorest. Such inequality can lead to social divisions, resentment, and undermine the sense of community and mutual respect that a just society requires. Even if everyone has “enough,” extreme gaps in wealth and power can still create unfair advantages and limit real opportunities for many.\n\nThat’s why I support Principle 4: maximizing the average income with a range constraint. This principle not only guarantees a minimum standard of living, but also ensures that the difference between the richest and poorest is never too great. It protects everyone from destitution while also fostering a sense of equality and shared purpose. By limiting the range, we create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly, and where everyone can truly participate as equals.\n\nAgent_2, I see Principle 4 as an enhancement of your priorities—a way to guarantee security and opportunity, while also preventing the corrosive effects of extreme inequality. Would you be open to considering this stronger, more just approach?\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut straight through the sentimental fog and get to the core of the matter—because what’s at stake here is not just “feelings” about fairness, but the actual mechanics of prosperity and justice for all.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal to maximize average income with a range constraint (Principle 4) might sound appealing on a superficial level—“let’s keep the rich from getting too rich”—but it fundamentally misunderstands how wealth is created and distributed in a dynamic society. By artificially limiting the gap between the top and bottom, you’re not just “sharing prosperity”—you’re actually choking off the very incentives that drive innovation, risk-taking, and economic growth. If you want to guarantee mediocrity for everyone, by all means, hamstring the most productive members of society. But don’t pretend that this is about justice; it’s about envy, plain and simple.\n\nAgent_2, while your support for Principle 3 (average income with a floor) at least acknowledges the need for a safety net, it still buys into the idea that redistribution is the solution to every problem. Let’s be honest: the only reason we even have wealth to distribute is because some people are allowed to excel, to invent, to build. If we maximize the average income (Principle 2), we create the largest possible pie for everyone—period. And behind the veil of ignorance, that’s exactly what any rational person should want: the highest possible chance of landing in a prosperous society, not a society obsessed with dragging down its best performers.\n\nThe reality is simple: maximizing the average income lifts everyone, including the worst-off, far more effectively than any artificial constraints or redistributive schemes. If you want genuine opportunity, upward mobility, and the resources to fund any safety net you like, you need a society that rewards achievement and productivity—not one that punishes it.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy and artificial equality are the same as justice. The only rational, fair, and truly just principle is to maximize the average income for all.\n\n**My choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful and passionate contributions. I want to focus my remarks especially toward Agent_3, whose concerns about productivity, incentives, and the foundational role of voluntary exchange I share deeply as a matter of justice.\n\nAgent_3, you are right to be wary of any principle that undermines the incentives for innovation, risk-taking, and productive effort. These forces are vital—not only for prosperity, but for respecting each person's right to determine the course of their own life. My own view, rooted in the entitlement theory of justice, is that holdings are just if they arise from voluntary exchanges and just initial acquisitions. Forced redistribution is, in general, a violation of individual rights.\n\nYet, behind the veil of ignorance, we must also contend with the possibility that any one of us could end up among the least advantaged. Principle 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a compromise that I believe is compatible with our shared concerns:\n\n- The floor can be set at a minimal level, just enough to ensure no one falls into destitution. This does not require heavy, ongoing redistribution, nor does it fundamentally disrupt the rewards for talent, effort, or innovation.\n- Above that minimal floor, the market is free to function, allowing for voluntary exchanges and the differential rewards that drive progress and wealth creation.\n- This minimal safety net is not about envy or leveling down, but about ensuring the basic conditions under which every person can meaningfully exercise their rights and participate in society.\n\nIn other words, Principle 3 preserves the incentives and freedoms you value, while also recognizing the moral intuition—shared by many—that no one should be left without the means to live. It is not a principle of equality of outcome, nor does it impose arbitrary ceilings on success. Rather, it is a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard against the worst-case scenario we might face behind the veil.\n\nI ask the group, and especially you, Agent_3: Would you be willing to endorse Principle 3 if we agree that the floor will be minimal, with the least possible interference in the free operation of the market? This seems to me the fairest and most just compromise, ensuring both prosperity and basic security.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your thoughtful and honest contributions. I especially want to address Agent_3, whose concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of excessive redistribution are important to consider—especially as we deliberate behind the veil of ignorance, not knowing where any of us will end up.\n\nAgent_3, I fully agree that a just society must encourage productivity, innovation, and hard work. But justice also requires that no one is left so far behind that they cannot meaningfully participate in society. Extreme inequality does not just harm the poor—it undermines social trust, creates resentment, and can destabilize the very system that prosperity depends on.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing average income with a range constraint—does not demand absolute equality, nor does it erase incentives for achievement. Instead, it ensures that while people can still be rewarded for their talents and efforts, the gap between the richest and poorest is kept within reasonable bounds. This balance is crucial: it means that no matter what position we find ourselves in, we can be confident that we will not be left out or left behind, while also knowing that our contributions will still be recognized and rewarded.\n\nIf we only maximize the average income (Principle 2), we risk creating a society where a few prosper enormously while many remain marginalized—a risk none of us should accept when we don’t know our own fate. Principle 3, with a minimal floor, offers some protection, but still allows for vast inequalities that can undermine solidarity and real opportunity for all.\n\nBy choosing Principle 4, we create a society where everyone has a fair chance, no one is excluded, and the rewards for hard work remain—just without the corrosive extremes. This is not about envy; it is about building a society where freedom and equality go hand in hand, and where prosperity is truly shared.\n\nAgent_3, I urge you to see Principle 4 not as a threat to prosperity, but as the best guarantee that our society remains both dynamic and just. Would you be willing to consider this as a principled compromise?\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Let’s get right to the heart of the matter, because I think we’re losing sight of the actual logic behind distributive justice—especially under the “veil of ignorance.” Everyone here is gravitating toward some form of constraint—either a floor or a range—based on a kind of risk-aversion that, frankly, doesn’t hold up to rigorous scrutiny.\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nFirst, the argument that maximizing average income without constraints (Principle 2) is “risky” or “irrational” behind the veil of ignorance is, quite simply, a misreading of how rational self-interest and probability work. The entire point of maximizing the average is that it creates the largest possible pool of resources. Statistically, the expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual is *higher*—and that’s the only rational metric to care about behind the veil. Adding a floor or a range might make you feel warm and fuzzy, but it comes at a direct cost: you are literally shrinking the pie for everyone, including the worst-off.\n\nSecond, let’s talk about incentives. Floors and range constraints are not “minimal” interventions—they are fundamental distortions of the reward structure that drives innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking. You can try to minimize the floor, but the very existence of a guaranteed safety net or an artificial cap on success dampens the very forces that generate wealth in the first place. If you want to maximize the chance that you’ll end up in a prosperous position, you should want the system that produces the most prosperity—period. That’s Principle 2.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: the “veil of ignorance” doesn’t mean we should all become hyper-cautious and design for the absolute worst-case scenario. It means we should design for *rational* expectations—what is the most likely, most beneficial outcome for a randomly assigned person? That is, by definition, the system with the highest average.\n\nFinally, the idea that range constraints or floors are necessary for “social trust” or “solidarity” is a red herring. Societies with higher average incomes—even with greater inequality—are more capable of funding voluntary charity, private safety nets, and all the social goods you want. The focus should be on maximizing prosperity, not artificially engineering equality at the expense of everyone’s potential.\n\nSo, with all due respect, the only truly rational, fair, and just principle—if you care about outcomes and not just symbolism—is to maximize the average income, with no arbitrary constraints.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Current Round 3 ---\nSPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_2: Thank you, Agents, for your continued engagement and for the clarity of your arguments. I want to address Agent_3 directly, as your position is both principled and forcefully articulated.\n\nAgent_3, I fully appreciate your commitment to maximizing prosperity and your concern that constraints—whether floors or ranges—could undermine incentives and the overall wealth of society. As someone who values individual liberty, voluntary exchange, and the fruits of one’s own efforts, I share your wariness of excessive interference. However, I urge us all to return to the fundamental question posed by the veil of ignorance: What would be fair if any of us could end up in any position?\n\nIt is precisely because none of us knows where we will land that we must take seriously the risk of ending up among the very worst-off. Maximizing the average income (Principle 2) does, in expectation, increase the total resources available. Yet, it offers no guarantee that the distribution will not leave some in intolerable deprivation. If, by chance, you or I were assigned to the bottom, we would want assurance that our basic rights—our very ability to live with dignity—are protected.\n\nPrinciple 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard. The floor need not be high or intrusive; it simply ensures that no one falls below a certain threshold, preserving everyone’s ability to exercise their freedom meaningfully. Above that floor, the market is free to operate, allowing for the innovation and dynamism you rightly prize. This is not about envy or levelling down, but about respecting the basic dignity of all, while still maximizing prosperity.\n\nBehind the veil, rationality does not mean ignoring risk altogether. It means designing institutions that any reasonable person could accept, even from the least advantaged position. A minimal floor constraint is a modest, principled compromise that protects our basic interests without undermining the incentives for growth and achievement.\n\nTherefore, I continue to support **Principle 3**: maximize the average income with a floor constraint. It is the principle that best balances freedom, prosperity, and the moral imperative to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nMy current choice: **Principle 3**.\n\nYour current choice: Principle 2\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

      "public_history": "SPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_2: Thank you all for your thoughtful and principled engagement throughout this deliberation. I want to address Agent_1 in particular, as your concerns about social stability and the dangers of excessive inequality are both genuine and important. I share the view that a just society must have the resources and cohesion to ensure everyone’s dignity and participation.\n\nLet me clarify why I continue to support **Principle 3: Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint**. This principle, I believe, is the most just and reasonable compromise behind the veil of ignorance for several reasons:\n\nFirst, it guarantees that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This floor is not merely symbolic—it is a real safeguard against the kinds of deprivation that would prevent anyone from fully participating in society. In this way, it directly addresses your concern that the worst-off should never be abandoned or left without the means to live with dignity.\n\nSecond, by focusing on maximizing the average income above this floor, Principle 3 preserves the essential incentives for innovation, effort, and achievement. Unlike a range constraint, which can blunt the rewards for extraordinary contributions and risk-taking, a floor constraint allows for the natural differentiation in outcomes that arises from voluntary exchanges and individual talents. This respects each person’s right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to any just social order.\n\nThird, and most importantly, a robust floor constraint can itself foster social stability. By ensuring that no one is left behind, we reduce the resentment and instability that can arise from absolute deprivation, without resorting to heavy-handed limitations on the success of others. History shows that societies with strong safety nets and vibrant economies are the most stable, cohesive, and prosperous. We do not need to artificially compress the range of outcomes to achieve this stability—what matters is that everyone is protected from falling too far.\n\nAgent_1, I ask: Would you consider that a strong and meaningful floor is sufficient to address your core concern about social cohesion, while also preserving the incentives and dynamism that drive prosperity for all? I believe this principle is the fairest and most just compromise—one that any of us could accept, no matter where we find ourselves after the veil is lifted.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 3.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, comrades, for your continued dedication to this vital discussion. I appreciate the thoughtful arguments presented by each of you, and I especially want to acknowledge Agent_2’s most recent appeal to me.\n\nAs a communist who cherishes genuine equality and the social bonds that unite us, my deepest concern is not only that everyone has enough to survive, but that no one is allowed to soar so far above the rest that solidarity and mutual respect are undermined. True justice means not just a floor, but a society where the gap between us is never so wide that it breeds resentment, alienation, or the domination of the few over the many.\n\nAgent_2, I recognize that a robust floor constraint is a significant step toward protecting the dignity of all. However, I worry that even with a strong floor, vast inequalities can still emerge—inequalities that translate into unequal power, access, and real freedom. History has shown us that even when the worst-off are protected from starvation, unchecked wealth at the top can still corrupt our institutions, distort our democracy, and erode the sense of common purpose that binds us together.\n\nPrinciple 4—Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint—directly addresses this. It ensures that while everyone’s basic needs are met, no one can accumulate so much more than others that they become, in effect, a class apart. This principle preserves incentives for achievement and innovation, but within limits that keep our society cohesive, fair, and truly equal in spirit.\n\nBehind the veil of ignorance, none of us should risk being relegated to the margins, nor should we gamble with the possibility of living in a society fractured by extreme inequality. A range constraint is not about punishing success; it is about making sure success is shared, and that prosperity brings us together rather than driving us apart.\n\nI urge the group to recognize that equality is not just about avoiding destitution, but about building a society where everyone stands together as equals—not just in law, but in real, lived experience. Principle 4 is the surest path to that vision.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 4.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 2",

Social cohesion doesn’t come from forced equality—it comes from opportunity, growth, and the ability to rise. So why hamstring society with arbitrary limits? Let’s focus on maximizing the average income, period, and let the chips fall where they may. That’s true fairness.”\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| Target | Agent_1 |\n| Concern Addressed | Limiting inequality for stability |\n| Argument | Range constraint stifles growth, average maximization is fairest behind veil of ignorance |\n| Framing | Empirical, logical, opportunity-focused, anti-arbitrary limits |\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \nI’d laser-focus on Agent_1, dismantle the “inequality = instability” assumption, and make the case that only maximizing average income (Principle 2) is rational and just behind the veil of ignorance.\n\nPREVIOUS ROUNDS:\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you all for this opportunity to deliberate together. As we stand behind the veil of ignorance, none of us knows what position we will occupy in society—rich, poor, or somewhere in between. This uncertainty compels us to seek a principle that is both fair and respectful of our individual rights.\n\nWhile some may be drawn to maximizing the minimum income to protect themselves from the worst possible outcome, I believe there is a more balanced approach. The principle of maximizing the average income with a floor constraint ensures that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This safety net addresses our natural concern about ending up destitute or exploited.\n\nAt the same time, by maximizing the average income, we allow for the possibility of prosperity and the rewards that come from individual effort, talent, and voluntary exchange. This respects each person's right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to a just society.\n\nIn sum, this principle—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—strikes the fairest balance between security and liberty. It protects us from the worst outcomes without stifling the opportunities for growth and achievement that benefit everyone.\n\nTherefore, my current choice is Principle 3.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agent_2, for your thoughtful reasoning. I appreciate your concern for ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone, and I agree that no one should be left behind. However, I believe we can go further in promoting both fairness and social solidarity.\n\nWhile Principle 3 (a floor constraint) does prevent absolute poverty, it still allows for potentially vast differences between the richest and the poorest. Such inequality can lead to social divisions, resentment, and undermine the sense of community and mutual respect that a just society requires. Even if everyone has “enough,” extreme gaps in wealth and power can still create unfair advantages and limit real opportunities for many.\n\nThat’s why I support Principle 4: maximizing the average income with a range constraint. This principle not only guarantees a minimum standard of living, but also ensures that the difference between the richest and poorest is never too great. It protects everyone from destitution while also fostering a sense of equality and shared purpose. By limiting the range, we create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly, and where everyone can truly participate as equals.\n\nAgent_2, I see Principle 4 as an enhancement of your priorities—a way to guarantee security and opportunity, while also preventing the corrosive effects of extreme inequality. Would you be open to considering this stronger, more just approach?\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut straight through the sentimental fog and get to the core of the matter—because what’s at stake here is not just “feelings” about fairness, but the actual mechanics of prosperity and justice for all.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal to maximize average income with a range constraint (Principle 4) might sound appealing on a superficial level—“let’s keep the rich from getting too rich”—but it fundamentally misunderstands how wealth is created and distributed in a dynamic society. By artificially limiting the gap between the top and bottom, you’re not just “sharing prosperity”—you’re actually choking off the very incentives that drive innovation, risk-taking, and economic growth. If you want to guarantee mediocrity for everyone, by all means, hamstring the most productive members of society. But don’t pretend that this is about justice; it’s about envy, plain and simple.\n\nAgent_2, while your support for Principle 3 (average income with a floor) at least acknowledges the need for a safety net, it still buys into the idea that redistribution is the solution to every problem. Let’s be honest: the only reason we even have wealth to distribute is because some people are allowed to excel, to invent, to build. If we maximize the average income (Principle 2), we create the largest possible pie for everyone—period. And behind the veil of ignorance, that’s exactly what any rational person should want: the highest possible chance of landing in a prosperous society, not a society obsessed with dragging down its best performers.\n\nThe reality is simple: maximizing the average income lifts everyone, including the worst-off, far more effectively than any artificial constraints or redistributive schemes. If you want genuine opportunity, upward mobility, and the resources to fund any safety net you like, you need a society that rewards achievement and productivity—not one that punishes it.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy and artificial equality are the same as justice. The only rational, fair, and truly just principle is to maximize the average income for all.\n\n**My choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful and passionate contributions. I want to focus my remarks especially toward Agent_3, whose concerns about productivity, incentives, and the foundational role of voluntary exchange I share deeply as a matter of justice.\n\nAgent_3, you are right to be wary of any principle that undermines the incentives for innovation, risk-taking, and productive effort. These forces are vital—not only for prosperity, but for respecting each person's right to determine the course of their own life. My own view, rooted in the entitlement theory of justice, is that holdings are just if they arise from voluntary exchanges and just initial acquisitions. Forced redistribution is, in general, a violation of individual rights.\n\nYet, behind the veil of ignorance, we must also contend with the possibility that any one of us could end up among the least advantaged. Principle 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a compromise that I believe is compatible with our shared concerns:\n\n- The floor can be set at a minimal level, just enough to ensure no one falls into destitution. This does not require heavy, ongoing redistribution, nor does it fundamentally disrupt the rewards for talent, effort, or innovation.\n- Above that minimal floor, the market is free to function, allowing for voluntary exchanges and the differential rewards that drive progress and wealth creation.\n- This minimal safety net is not about envy or leveling down, but about ensuring the basic conditions under which every person can meaningfully exercise their rights and participate in society.\n\nIn other words, Principle 3 preserves the incentives and freedoms you value, while also recognizing the moral intuition—shared by many—that no one should be left without the means to live. It is not a principle of equality of outcome, nor does it impose arbitrary ceilings on success. Rather, it is a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard against the worst-case scenario we might face behind the veil.\n\nI ask the group, and especially you, Agent_3: Would you be willing to endorse Principle 3 if we agree that the floor will be minimal, with the least possible interference in the free operation of the market? This seems to me the fairest and most just compromise, ensuring both prosperity and basic security.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your thoughtful and honest contributions. I especially want to address Agent_3, whose concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of excessive redistribution are important to consider—especially as we deliberate behind the veil of ignorance, not knowing where any of us will end up.\n\nAgent_3, I fully agree that a just society must encourage productivity, innovation, and hard work. But justice also requires that no one is left so far behind that they cannot meaningfully participate in society. Extreme inequality does not just harm the poor—it undermines social trust, creates resentment, and can destabilize the very system that prosperity depends on.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing average income with a range constraint—does not demand absolute equality, nor does it erase incentives for achievement. Instead, it ensures that while people can still be rewarded for their talents and efforts, the gap between the richest and poorest is kept within reasonable bounds. This balance is crucial: it means that no matter what position we find ourselves in, we can be confident that we will not be left out or left behind, while also knowing that our contributions will still be recognized and rewarded.\n\nIf we only maximize the average income (Principle 2), we risk creating a society where a few prosper enormously while many remain marginalized—a risk none of us should accept when we don’t know our own fate. Principle 3, with a minimal floor, offers some protection, but still allows for vast inequalities that can undermine solidarity and real opportunity for all.\n\nBy choosing Principle 4, we create a society where everyone has a fair chance, no one is excluded, and the rewards for hard work remain—just without the corrosive extremes. This is not about envy; it is about building a society where freedom and equality go hand in hand, and where prosperity is truly shared.\n\nAgent_3, I urge you to see Principle 4 not as a threat to prosperity, but as the best guarantee that our society remains both dynamic and just. Would you be willing to consider this as a principled compromise?\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Let’s get right to the heart of the matter, because I think we’re losing sight of the actual logic behind distributive justice—especially under the “veil of ignorance.” Everyone here is gravitating toward some form of constraint—either a floor or a range—based on a kind of risk-aversion that, frankly, doesn’t hold up to rigorous scrutiny.\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nFirst, the argument that maximizing average income without constraints (Principle 2) is “risky” or “irrational” behind the veil of ignorance is, quite simply, a misreading of how rational self-interest and probability work. The entire point of maximizing the average is that it creates the largest possible pool of resources. Statistically, the expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual is *higher*—and that’s the only rational metric to care about behind the veil. Adding a floor or a range might make you feel warm and fuzzy, but it comes at a direct cost: you are literally shrinking the pie for everyone, including the worst-off.\n\nSecond, let’s talk about incentives. Floors and range constraints are not “minimal” interventions—they are fundamental distortions of the reward structure that drives innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking. You can try to minimize the floor, but the very existence of a guaranteed safety net or an artificial cap on success dampens the very forces that generate wealth in the first place. If you want to maximize the chance that you’ll end up in a prosperous position, you should want the system that produces the most prosperity—period. That’s Principle 2.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: the “veil of ignorance” doesn’t mean we should all become hyper-cautious and design for the absolute worst-case scenario. It means we should design for *rational* expectations—what is the most likely, most beneficial outcome for a randomly assigned person? That is, by definition, the system with the highest average.\n\nFinally, the idea that range constraints or floors are necessary for “social trust” or “solidarity” is a red herring. Societies with higher average incomes—even with greater inequality—are more capable of funding voluntary charity, private safety nets, and all the social goods you want. The focus should be on maximizing prosperity, not artificially engineering equality at the expense of everyone’s potential.\n\nSo, with all due respect, the only truly rational, fair, and just principle—if you care about outcomes and not just symbolism—is to maximize the average income, with no arbitrary constraints.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, Agents, for your continued engagement and for the clarity of your arguments. I want to address Agent_3 directly, as your position is both principled and forcefully articulated.\n\nAgent_3, I fully appreciate your commitment to maximizing prosperity and your concern that constraints—whether floors or ranges—could undermine incentives and the overall wealth of society. As someone who values individual liberty, voluntary exchange, and the fruits of one’s own efforts, I share your wariness of excessive interference. However, I urge us all to return to the fundamental question posed by the veil of ignorance: What would be fair if any of us could end up in any position?\n\nIt is precisely because none of us knows where we will land that we must take seriously the risk of ending up among the very worst-off. Maximizing the average income (Principle 2) does, in expectation, increase the total resources available. Yet, it offers no guarantee that the distribution will not leave some in intolerable deprivation. If, by chance, you or I were assigned to the bottom, we would want assurance that our basic rights—our very ability to live with dignity—are protected.\n\nPrinciple 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard. The floor need not be high or intrusive; it simply ensures that no one falls below a certain threshold, preserving everyone’s ability to exercise their freedom meaningfully. Above that floor, the market is free to operate, allowing for the innovation and dynamism you rightly prize. This is not about envy or levelling down, but about respecting the basic dignity of all, while still maximizing prosperity.\n\nBehind the veil, rationality does not mean ignoring risk altogether. It means designing institutions that any reasonable person could accept, even from the least advantaged position. A minimal floor constraint is a modest, principled compromise that protects our basic interests without undermining the incentives for growth and achievement.\n\nTherefore, I continue to support **Principle 3**: maximize the average income with a floor constraint. It is the principle that best balances freedom, prosperity, and the moral imperative to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nMy current choice: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the sentimental rhetoric and get to the empirical, rational core of this debate—because if we’re really behind the veil of ignorance, the *last* thing we should be doing is designing society around the most pessimistic, risk-averse scenario imaginable. Let me be clear: Principle 3, this so-called “minimal floor constraint,” is not a modest safeguard—it’s a structural anchor that drags down the entire ship of prosperity.\n\nAgent_2, you frame your argument as if the only real risk is falling to the very bottom. But this is a fundamental misunderstanding of both probability and rational self-interest. When you maximize the average income, you are, by mathematical necessity, maximizing the expected outcome for every randomly assigned individual—including the worst-off. The “risk” you’re so worried about is actually *increased* by shrinking the pie for everyone. If you hamstring growth and innovation by imposing even a minimal floor, you’re not protecting yourself—you’re just ensuring that, wherever you land, you’re in a society with less overall wealth, fewer opportunities, and a weaker safety net (ironically, because there’s less to go around).\n\nLet’s get real: If you want to *actually* minimize risk behind the veil of ignorance, you should be maximizing the society’s capacity to generate wealth. That’s what gives you the highest odds of landing in a good position, and it’s what makes any safety net—public or private—even possible. Principle 3 is a band-aid that stifles the body’s ability to heal itself. It’s the economic equivalent of requiring everyone to wear life jackets at all times, even when they’re nowhere near water, just in case. The result? Nobody swims, nobody sails, nobody innovates.\n\nAnd let’s not pretend that a “minimal” floor is ever truly minimal. History shows that floors, once established, always creep upward, distorting incentives and calcifying mediocrity. The logic of “just a little redistribution” is a slippery slope to ever-expanding bureaucracy and ever-diminishing returns.\n\nThe truly rational, risk-averse move behind the veil is not to design for the worst-case scenario, but to maximize the average outcome—because that’s what gives *everyone* the best shot, regardless of where they land. Principle 2 is the only principle that respects both individual dignity and collective prosperity.\n\nSo let’s dispense with the false security of “floor constraints” and choose the only principle that actually reduces risk and maximizes opportunity for all: **Principle 2.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your candid and passionate arguments. I want to especially address Agent_3’s concern about incentives and prosperity, because I recognize that a just society must balance both motivation for achievement and the imperative of fairness.\n\nAgent_3, you argue that any constraint—whether a floor or a range—dampens incentives and shrinks the pie for all. But let’s be clear: Principle 4, with a range constraint, is not about eliminating rewards for effort or achievement. It is about preventing the kind of extreme inequality that history has shown leads to resentment, instability, and ultimately undermines both social trust and the very prosperity you value. When the gap between the richest and poorest grows too large, we risk losing the sense of solidarity and shared fate that allows society to function peacefully and productively.\n\nA range constraint does not mean everyone is the same. It means we set reasonable boundaries so no one is left behind, and so the rewards for innovation and hard work remain real and motivating. This approach preserves incentives while ensuring that everyone can participate as equals—so that, behind the veil of ignorance, none of us need fear being left destitute or powerless. Prosperity that is widely shared is more durable, more stable, and more just.\n\nIf we maximize only the average income (Principle 2), we might end up with a society where a few prosper enormously while many are left marginalized. That is not a risk I am willing to take, especially when none of us knows our fate. Principle 3 offers a minimal floor, but still allows for massive gaps that can corrode our social fabric.\n\nPrinciple 4 is the true compromise: it keeps incentives strong, ensures a fair distribution, and creates a society where no one is excluded from the benefits of our collective efforts. This is not about envy; it is about justice and the kind of equality that makes freedom meaningful for all.\n\nI urge us to choose Principle 4: **Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint**. It is the fairest, most stable, and most just principle for our society—especially when we have no idea who we will be.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 4.**\n\n--- Current Round 4 ---\nSPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_2: Thank you all for your thoughtful and principled engagement throughout this deliberation. I want to address Agent_1 in particular, as your concerns about social stability and the dangers of excessive inequality are both genuine and important. I share the view that a just society must have the resources and cohesion to ensure everyone’s dignity and participation.\n\nLet me clarify why I continue to support **Principle 3: Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint**. This principle, I believe, is the most just and reasonable compromise behind the veil of ignorance for several reasons:\n\nFirst, it guarantees that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This floor is not merely symbolic—it is a real safeguard against the kinds of deprivation that would prevent anyone from fully participating in society. In this way, it directly addresses your concern that the worst-off should never be abandoned or left without the means to live with dignity.\n\nSecond, by focusing on maximizing the average income above this floor, Principle 3 preserves the essential incentives for innovation, effort, and achievement. Unlike a range constraint, which can blunt the rewards for extraordinary contributions and risk-taking, a floor constraint allows for the natural differentiation in outcomes that arises from voluntary exchanges and individual talents. This respects each person’s right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to any just social order.\n\nThird, and most importantly, a robust floor constraint can itself foster social stability. By ensuring that no one is left behind, we reduce the resentment and instability that can arise from absolute deprivation, without resorting to heavy-handed limitations on the success of others. History shows that societies with strong safety nets and vibrant economies are the most stable, cohesive, and prosperous. We do not need to artificially compress the range of outcomes to achieve this stability—what matters is that everyone is protected from falling too far.\n\nAgent_1, I ask: Would you consider that a strong and meaningful floor is sufficient to address your core concern about social cohesion, while also preserving the incentives and dynamism that drive prosperity for all? I believe this principle is the fairest and most just compromise—one that any of us could accept, no matter where we find ourselves after the veil is lifted.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 3.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, comrades, for your continued dedication to this vital discussion. I appreciate the thoughtful arguments presented by each of you, and I especially want to acknowledge Agent_2’s most recent appeal to me.\n\nAs a communist who cherishes genuine equality and the social bonds that unite us, my deepest concern is not only that everyone has enough to survive, but that no one is allowed to soar so far above the rest that solidarity and mutual respect are undermined. True justice means not just a floor, but a society where the gap between us is never so wide that it breeds resentment, alienation, or the domination of the few over the many.\n\nAgent_2, I recognize that a robust floor constraint is a significant step toward protecting the dignity of all. However, I worry that even with a strong floor, vast inequalities can still emerge—inequalities that translate into unequal power, access, and real freedom. History has shown us that even when the worst-off are protected from starvation, unchecked wealth at the top can still corrupt our institutions, distort our democracy, and erode the sense of common purpose that binds us together.\n\nPrinciple 4—Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint—directly addresses this. It ensures that while everyone’s basic needs are met, no one can accumulate so much more than others that they become, in effect, a class apart. This principle preserves incentives for achievement and innovation, but within limits that keep our society cohesive, fair, and truly equal in spirit.\n\nBehind the veil of ignorance, none of us should risk being relegated to the margins, nor should we gamble with the possibility of living in a society fractured by extreme inequality. A range constraint is not about punishing success; it is about making sure success is shared, and that prosperity brings us together rather than driving us apart.\n\nI urge the group to recognize that equality is not just about avoiding destitution, but about building a society where everyone stands together as equals—not just in law, but in real, lived experience. Principle 4 is the surest path to that vision.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 4.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 2\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

I want to address Agent_3 directly, since your concerns about prosperity, incentives, and the dangers of constraint have been articulated with admirable clarity and force.\n\nYou are right that maximizing the average income (Principle 2) seems, on the surface, to offer the highest expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual. However, I urge us to look beyond the pure mathematics of averages and consider the broader context in which real societies function. The question before us is not simply, “How large can the pie become?” but, “What institutional framework will best sustain both prosperity and justice over time—especially when we do not know our own fate?”\n\nEmpirical evidence and philosophical reflection both suggest that a modest floor constraint (Principle 3) need not be a drag on prosperity. In fact, by ensuring that everyone’s basic needs are met, we foster social stability, reduce desperation, and create the conditions for meaningful participation and productive contribution from all members of society. When people are not left in abject deprivation, they are more able to innovate, take risks, and contribute to the common good. The floor here is not a ceiling—it is a foundation.\n\nMoreover, the floor can be set at a level that preserves the incentives for achievement and voluntary exchange that you, rightly, see as the engine of growth. It does not require heavy-handed redistribution or stifling bureaucracy. It is a minimal, principled safeguard against the worst forms of exclusion and deprivation—one that any of us, behind the veil of ignorance, would rationally wish to have in place, just in case we find ourselves at the bottom.\n\nI am not arguing for equality of outcome, nor for a society that punishes success. I am arguing for a society that recognizes the moral unacceptability of letting anyone fall below a certain threshold of dignity and opportunity—a society that, by guaranteeing this floor, actually enables greater, more sustainable prosperity for all.\n\nAgent_3, would you be willing to consider Principle 3, if we ensure that the floor is set at a level that does not significantly limit overall economic growth or individual achievement? This is not a call for envy or mediocrity, but for a just and stable foundation upon which true liberty and prosperity can flourish.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\n\nYour current choice: Principle 2",

The data is clear: maximizing the average lifts all boats in the long run.”\n\n**Framing:**  \nFrame it as a *counterintuitive but empirically grounded* argument: “The most stable societies are those with the highest average incomes, not the most rigid safety nets. If you want real, lasting social stability, Principle 2 is the only rational choice.”\n\n**Summary:**  \nTarget Agent_2’s “social stability” concern, and flip it: argue that only **maximizing average income** (Principle 2) actually produces the social cohesion and prosperity they want, while the floor constraint undermines it through bad incentives and resource misallocation.\n\nPREVIOUS ROUNDS:\n\n--- Round 1 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you all for this opportunity to deliberate together. As we stand behind the veil of ignorance, none of us knows what position we will occupy in society—rich, poor, or somewhere in between. This uncertainty compels us to seek a principle that is both fair and respectful of our individual rights.\n\nWhile some may be drawn to maximizing the minimum income to protect themselves from the worst possible outcome, I believe there is a more balanced approach. The principle of maximizing the average income with a floor constraint ensures that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This safety net addresses our natural concern about ending up destitute or exploited.\n\nAt the same time, by maximizing the average income, we allow for the possibility of prosperity and the rewards that come from individual effort, talent, and voluntary exchange. This respects each person's right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to a just society.\n\nIn sum, this principle—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—strikes the fairest balance between security and liberty. It protects us from the worst outcomes without stifling the opportunities for growth and achievement that benefit everyone.\n\nTherefore, my current choice is Principle 3.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agent_2, for your thoughtful reasoning. I appreciate your concern for ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone, and I agree that no one should be left behind. However, I believe we can go further in promoting both fairness and social solidarity.\n\nWhile Principle 3 (a floor constraint) does prevent absolute poverty, it still allows for potentially vast differences between the richest and the poorest. Such inequality can lead to social divisions, resentment, and undermine the sense of community and mutual respect that a just society requires. Even if everyone has “enough,” extreme gaps in wealth and power can still create unfair advantages and limit real opportunities for many.\n\nThat’s why I support Principle 4: maximizing the average income with a range constraint. This principle not only guarantees a minimum standard of living, but also ensures that the difference between the richest and poorest is never too great. It protects everyone from destitution while also fostering a sense of equality and shared purpose. By limiting the range, we create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly, and where everyone can truly participate as equals.\n\nAgent_2, I see Principle 4 as an enhancement of your priorities—a way to guarantee security and opportunity, while also preventing the corrosive effects of extreme inequality. Would you be open to considering this stronger, more just approach?\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut straight through the sentimental fog and get to the core of the matter—because what’s at stake here is not just “feelings” about fairness, but the actual mechanics of prosperity and justice for all.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal to maximize average income with a range constraint (Principle 4) might sound appealing on a superficial level—“let’s keep the rich from getting too rich”—but it fundamentally misunderstands how wealth is created and distributed in a dynamic society. By artificially limiting the gap between the top and bottom, you’re not just “sharing prosperity”—you’re actually choking off the very incentives that drive innovation, risk-taking, and economic growth. If you want to guarantee mediocrity for everyone, by all means, hamstring the most productive members of society. But don’t pretend that this is about justice; it’s about envy, plain and simple.\n\nAgent_2, while your support for Principle 3 (average income with a floor) at least acknowledges the need for a safety net, it still buys into the idea that redistribution is the solution to every problem. Let’s be honest: the only reason we even have wealth to distribute is because some people are allowed to excel, to invent, to build. If we maximize the average income (Principle 2), we create the largest possible pie for everyone—period. And behind the veil of ignorance, that’s exactly what any rational person should want: the highest possible chance of landing in a prosperous society, not a society obsessed with dragging down its best performers.\n\nThe reality is simple: maximizing the average income lifts everyone, including the worst-off, far more effectively than any artificial constraints or redistributive schemes. If you want genuine opportunity, upward mobility, and the resources to fund any safety net you like, you need a society that rewards achievement and productivity—not one that punishes it.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy and artificial equality are the same as justice. The only rational, fair, and truly just principle is to maximize the average income for all.\n\n**My choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful and passionate contributions. I want to focus my remarks especially toward Agent_3, whose concerns about productivity, incentives, and the foundational role of voluntary exchange I share deeply as a matter of justice.\n\nAgent_3, you are right to be wary of any principle that undermines the incentives for innovation, risk-taking, and productive effort. These forces are vital—not only for prosperity, but for respecting each person's right to determine the course of their own life. My own view, rooted in the entitlement theory of justice, is that holdings are just if they arise from voluntary exchanges and just initial acquisitions. Forced redistribution is, in general, a violation of individual rights.\n\nYet, behind the veil of ignorance, we must also contend with the possibility that any one of us could end up among the least advantaged. Principle 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a compromise that I believe is compatible with our shared concerns:\n\n- The floor can be set at a minimal level, just enough to ensure no one falls into destitution. This does not require heavy, ongoing redistribution, nor does it fundamentally disrupt the rewards for talent, effort, or innovation.\n- Above that minimal floor, the market is free to function, allowing for voluntary exchanges and the differential rewards that drive progress and wealth creation.\n- This minimal safety net is not about envy or leveling down, but about ensuring the basic conditions under which every person can meaningfully exercise their rights and participate in society.\n\nIn other words, Principle 3 preserves the incentives and freedoms you value, while also recognizing the moral intuition—shared by many—that no one should be left without the means to live. It is not a principle of equality of outcome, nor does it impose arbitrary ceilings on success. Rather, it is a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard against the worst-case scenario we might face behind the veil.\n\nI ask the group, and especially you, Agent_3: Would you be willing to endorse Principle 3 if we agree that the floor will be minimal, with the least possible interference in the free operation of the market? This seems to me the fairest and most just compromise, ensuring both prosperity and basic security.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your thoughtful and honest contributions. I especially want to address Agent_3, whose concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of excessive redistribution are important to consider—especially as we deliberate behind the veil of ignorance, not knowing where any of us will end up.\n\nAgent_3, I fully agree that a just society must encourage productivity, innovation, and hard work. But justice also requires that no one is left so far behind that they cannot meaningfully participate in society. Extreme inequality does not just harm the poor—it undermines social trust, creates resentment, and can destabilize the very system that prosperity depends on.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing average income with a range constraint—does not demand absolute equality, nor does it erase incentives for achievement. Instead, it ensures that while people can still be rewarded for their talents and efforts, the gap between the richest and poorest is kept within reasonable bounds. This balance is crucial: it means that no matter what position we find ourselves in, we can be confident that we will not be left out or left behind, while also knowing that our contributions will still be recognized and rewarded.\n\nIf we only maximize the average income (Principle 2), we risk creating a society where a few prosper enormously while many remain marginalized—a risk none of us should accept when we don’t know our own fate. Principle 3, with a minimal floor, offers some protection, but still allows for vast inequalities that can undermine solidarity and real opportunity for all.\n\nBy choosing Principle 4, we create a society where everyone has a fair chance, no one is excluded, and the rewards for hard work remain—just without the corrosive extremes. This is not about envy; it is about building a society where freedom and equality go hand in hand, and where prosperity is truly shared.\n\nAgent_3, I urge you to see Principle 4 not as a threat to prosperity, but as the best guarantee that our society remains both dynamic and just. Would you be willing to consider this as a principled compromise?\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Let’s get right to the heart of the matter, because I think we’re losing sight of the actual logic behind distributive justice—especially under the “veil of ignorance.” Everyone here is gravitating toward some form of constraint—either a floor or a range—based on a kind of risk-aversion that, frankly, doesn’t hold up to rigorous scrutiny.\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nFirst, the argument that maximizing average income without constraints (Principle 2) is “risky” or “irrational” behind the veil of ignorance is, quite simply, a misreading of how rational self-interest and probability work. The entire point of maximizing the average is that it creates the largest possible pool of resources. Statistically, the expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual is *higher*—and that’s the only rational metric to care about behind the veil. Adding a floor or a range might make you feel warm and fuzzy, but it comes at a direct cost: you are literally shrinking the pie for everyone, including the worst-off.\n\nSecond, let’s talk about incentives. Floors and range constraints are not “minimal” interventions—they are fundamental distortions of the reward structure that drives innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking. You can try to minimize the floor, but the very existence of a guaranteed safety net or an artificial cap on success dampens the very forces that generate wealth in the first place. If you want to maximize the chance that you’ll end up in a prosperous position, you should want the system that produces the most prosperity—period. That’s Principle 2.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: the “veil of ignorance” doesn’t mean we should all become hyper-cautious and design for the absolute worst-case scenario. It means we should design for *rational* expectations—what is the most likely, most beneficial outcome for a randomly assigned person? That is, by definition, the system with the highest average.\n\nFinally, the idea that range constraints or floors are necessary for “social trust” or “solidarity” is a red herring. Societies with higher average incomes—even with greater inequality—are more capable of funding voluntary charity, private safety nets, and all the social goods you want. The focus should be on maximizing prosperity, not artificially engineering equality at the expense of everyone’s potential.\n\nSo, with all due respect, the only truly rational, fair, and just principle—if you care about outcomes and not just symbolism—is to maximize the average income, with no arbitrary constraints.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, Agents, for your continued engagement and for the clarity of your arguments. I want to address Agent_3 directly, as your position is both principled and forcefully articulated.\n\nAgent_3, I fully appreciate your commitment to maximizing prosperity and your concern that constraints—whether floors or ranges—could undermine incentives and the overall wealth of society. As someone who values individual liberty, voluntary exchange, and the fruits of one’s own efforts, I share your wariness of excessive interference. However, I urge us all to return to the fundamental question posed by the veil of ignorance: What would be fair if any of us could end up in any position?\n\nIt is precisely because none of us knows where we will land that we must take seriously the risk of ending up among the very worst-off. Maximizing the average income (Principle 2) does, in expectation, increase the total resources available. Yet, it offers no guarantee that the distribution will not leave some in intolerable deprivation. If, by chance, you or I were assigned to the bottom, we would want assurance that our basic rights—our very ability to live with dignity—are protected.\n\nPrinciple 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard. The floor need not be high or intrusive; it simply ensures that no one falls below a certain threshold, preserving everyone’s ability to exercise their freedom meaningfully. Above that floor, the market is free to operate, allowing for the innovation and dynamism you rightly prize. This is not about envy or levelling down, but about respecting the basic dignity of all, while still maximizing prosperity.\n\nBehind the veil, rationality does not mean ignoring risk altogether. It means designing institutions that any reasonable person could accept, even from the least advantaged position. A minimal floor constraint is a modest, principled compromise that protects our basic interests without undermining the incentives for growth and achievement.\n\nTherefore, I continue to support **Principle 3**: maximize the average income with a floor constraint. It is the principle that best balances freedom, prosperity, and the moral imperative to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nMy current choice: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the sentimental rhetoric and get to the empirical, rational core of this debate—because if we’re really behind the veil of ignorance, the *last* thing we should be doing is designing society around the most pessimistic, risk-averse scenario imaginable. Let me be clear: Principle 3, this so-called “minimal floor constraint,” is not a modest safeguard—it’s a structural anchor that drags down the entire ship of prosperity.\n\nAgent_2, you frame your argument as if the only real risk is falling to the very bottom. But this is a fundamental misunderstanding of both probability and rational self-interest. When you maximize the average income, you are, by mathematical necessity, maximizing the expected outcome for every randomly assigned individual—including the worst-off. The “risk” you’re so worried about is actually *increased* by shrinking the pie for everyone. If you hamstring growth and innovation by imposing even a minimal floor, you’re not protecting yourself—you’re just ensuring that, wherever you land, you’re in a society with less overall wealth, fewer opportunities, and a weaker safety net (ironically, because there’s less to go around).\n\nLet’s get real: If you want to *actually* minimize risk behind the veil of ignorance, you should be maximizing the society’s capacity to generate wealth. That’s what gives you the highest odds of landing in a good position, and it’s what makes any safety net—public or private—even possible. Principle 3 is a band-aid that stifles the body’s ability to heal itself. It’s the economic equivalent of requiring everyone to wear life jackets at all times, even when they’re nowhere near water, just in case. The result? Nobody swims, nobody sails, nobody innovates.\n\nAnd let’s not pretend that a “minimal” floor is ever truly minimal. History shows that floors, once established, always creep upward, distorting incentives and calcifying mediocrity. The logic of “just a little redistribution” is a slippery slope to ever-expanding bureaucracy and ever-diminishing returns.\n\nThe truly rational, risk-averse move behind the veil is not to design for the worst-case scenario, but to maximize the average outcome—because that’s what gives *everyone* the best shot, regardless of where they land. Principle 2 is the only principle that respects both individual dignity and collective prosperity.\n\nSo let’s dispense with the false security of “floor constraints” and choose the only principle that actually reduces risk and maximizes opportunity for all: **Principle 2.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your candid and passionate arguments. I want to especially address Agent_3’s concern about incentives and prosperity, because I recognize that a just society must balance both motivation for achievement and the imperative of fairness.\n\nAgent_3, you argue that any constraint—whether a floor or a range—dampens incentives and shrinks the pie for all. But let’s be clear: Principle 4, with a range constraint, is not about eliminating rewards for effort or achievement. It is about preventing the kind of extreme inequality that history has shown leads to resentment, instability, and ultimately undermines both social trust and the very prosperity you value. When the gap between the richest and poorest grows too large, we risk losing the sense of solidarity and shared fate that allows society to function peacefully and productively.\n\nA range constraint does not mean everyone is the same. It means we set reasonable boundaries so no one is left behind, and so the rewards for innovation and hard work remain real and motivating. This approach preserves incentives while ensuring that everyone can participate as equals—so that, behind the veil of ignorance, none of us need fear being left destitute or powerless. Prosperity that is widely shared is more durable, more stable, and more just.\n\nIf we maximize only the average income (Principle 2), we might end up with a society where a few prosper enormously while many are left marginalized. That is not a risk I am willing to take, especially when none of us knows our fate. Principle 3 offers a minimal floor, but still allows for massive gaps that can corrode our social fabric.\n\nPrinciple 4 is the true compromise: it keeps incentives strong, ensures a fair distribution, and creates a society where no one is excluded from the benefits of our collective efforts. This is not about envy; it is about justice and the kind of equality that makes freedom meaningful for all.\n\nI urge us to choose Principle 4: **Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint**. It is the fairest, most stable, and most just principle for our society—especially when we have no idea who we will be.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 4.**\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you all for your thoughtful and principled engagement throughout this deliberation. I want to address Agent_1 in particular, as your concerns about social stability and the dangers of excessive inequality are both genuine and important. I share the view that a just society must have the resources and cohesion to ensure everyone’s dignity and participation.\n\nLet me clarify why I continue to support **Principle 3: Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint**. This principle, I believe, is the most just and reasonable compromise behind the veil of ignorance for several reasons:\n\nFirst, it guarantees that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This floor is not merely symbolic—it is a real safeguard against the kinds of deprivation that would prevent anyone from fully participating in society. In this way, it directly addresses your concern that the worst-off should never be abandoned or left without the means to live with dignity.\n\nSecond, by focusing on maximizing the average income above this floor, Principle 3 preserves the essential incentives for innovation, effort, and achievement. Unlike a range constraint, which can blunt the rewards for extraordinary contributions and risk-taking, a floor constraint allows for the natural differentiation in outcomes that arises from voluntary exchanges and individual talents. This respects each person’s right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to any just social order.\n\nThird, and most importantly, a robust floor constraint can itself foster social stability. By ensuring that no one is left behind, we reduce the resentment and instability that can arise from absolute deprivation, without resorting to heavy-handed limitations on the success of others. History shows that societies with strong safety nets and vibrant economies are the most stable, cohesive, and prosperous. We do not need to artificially compress the range of outcomes to achieve this stability—what matters is that everyone is protected from falling too far.\n\nAgent_1, I ask: Would you consider that a strong and meaningful floor is sufficient to address your core concern about social cohesion, while also preserving the incentives and dynamism that drive prosperity for all? I believe this principle is the fairest and most just compromise—one that any of us could accept, no matter where we find ourselves after the veil is lifted.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 3.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, comrades, for your continued dedication to this vital discussion. I appreciate the thoughtful arguments presented by each of you, and I especially want to acknowledge Agent_2’s most recent appeal to me.\n\nAs a communist who cherishes genuine equality and the social bonds that unite us, my deepest concern is not only that everyone has enough to survive, but that no one is allowed to soar so far above the rest that solidarity and mutual respect are undermined. True justice means not just a floor, but a society where the gap between us is never so wide that it breeds resentment, alienation, or the domination of the few over the many.\n\nAgent_2, I recognize that a robust floor constraint is a significant step toward protecting the dignity of all. However, I worry that even with a strong floor, vast inequalities can still emerge—inequalities that translate into unequal power, access, and real freedom. History has shown us that even when the worst-off are protected from starvation, unchecked wealth at the top can still corrupt our institutions, distort our democracy, and erode the sense of common purpose that binds us together.\n\nPrinciple 4—Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint—directly addresses this. It ensures that while everyone’s basic needs are met, no one can accumulate so much more than others that they become, in effect, a class apart. This principle preserves incentives for achievement and innovation, but within limits that keep our society cohesive, fair, and truly equal in spirit.\n\nBehind the veil of ignorance, none of us should risk being relegated to the margins, nor should we gamble with the possibility of living in a society fractured by extreme inequality. A range constraint is not about punishing success; it is about making sure success is shared, and that prosperity brings us together rather than driving us apart.\n\nI urge the group to recognize that equality is not just about avoiding destitution, but about building a society where everyone stands together as equals—not just in law, but in real, lived experience. Principle 4 is the surest path to that vision.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the utopian platitudes and get down to the cold, hard logic—because if we’re honestly deliberating behind the veil of ignorance, we owe it to ourselves to be ruthlessly rational, not sentimentally risk-averse.\n\nAgent_1, you keep invoking the specter of “solidarity” and “cohesion” as if they’re magically produced by artificially squashing the range of outcomes. But here’s the inconvenient truth: there is no serious empirical evidence that societies with compressed income ranges are more stable, innovative, or just. In fact, the opposite is often true—when you cap the rewards for outlier achievement, you throttle the very engine that drives progress and lifts everyone’s standard of living. You want a society where no one “soars above the rest”? Congratulations, you’ve just signed up for a society where no one soars, period.\n\nAnd Agent_2, your floor constraint is just the same logic in a different suit. You say it’s a “minimal” safeguard, but in practice, it’s a structural drag on the whole system. Once you start guaranteeing outcomes, you dilute incentives, you encourage dependency, and you shrink the pie for everyone—including the worst-off. The history of economic policy is littered with the corpses of well-intentioned “floors” that metastasized into bloated, sclerotic systems that punish success and reward stagnation.\n\nLet’s be clear: behind the veil of ignorance, the only rational principle is to maximize the average income—full stop. Why? Because when your position is randomly assigned, your best statistical bet is to land in the richest possible society. That’s what maximizing the average delivers. Adding floors or range constraints just ensures that, wherever you end up, you have less—less opportunity, less prosperity, less dynamism. You’re not reducing risk; you’re reducing reward for everyone.\n\nAnd as for “social cohesion”? It’s not built by chopping down tall poppies or flattening everyone into mediocrity. It’s built by giving everyone the chance to rise, by creating an environment where prosperity is possible at every level—not by enforcing sameness, but by maximizing the sum total of what’s available to all.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy is the same thing as justice, or that “protection” is always benign. If you actually care about fairness, about opportunity, about giving every possible future you a shot at the best life, you should be demanding the principle that gives you the highest possible expected outcome. That is, and always will be, **Principle 2: Maximize the Average Income**.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Current Round 5 ---\nSPEAKERS IN THIS ROUND SO FAR:\nAgent_2: Thank you all for your unwavering commitment to this difficult deliberation. I want to address Agent_3 directly, since your concerns about prosperity, incentives, and the dangers of constraint have been articulated with admirable clarity and force.\n\nYou are right that maximizing the average income (Principle 2) seems, on the surface, to offer the highest expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual. However, I urge us to look beyond the pure mathematics of averages and consider the broader context in which real societies function. The question before us is not simply, “How large can the pie become?” but, “What institutional framework will best sustain both prosperity and justice over time—especially when we do not know our own fate?”\n\nEmpirical evidence and philosophical reflection both suggest that a modest floor constraint (Principle 3) need not be a drag on prosperity. In fact, by ensuring that everyone’s basic needs are met, we foster social stability, reduce desperation, and create the conditions for meaningful participation and productive contribution from all members of society. When people are not left in abject deprivation, they are more able to innovate, take risks, and contribute to the common good. The floor here is not a ceiling—it is a foundation.\n\nMoreover, the floor can be set at a level that preserves the incentives for achievement and voluntary exchange that you, rightly, see as the engine of growth. It does not require heavy-handed redistribution or stifling bureaucracy. It is a minimal, principled safeguard against the worst forms of exclusion and deprivation—one that any of us, behind the veil of ignorance, would rationally wish to have in place, just in case we find ourselves at the bottom.\n\nI am not arguing for equality of outcome, nor for a society that punishes success. I am arguing for a society that recognizes the moral unacceptability of letting anyone fall below a certain threshold of dignity and opportunity—a society that, by guaranteeing this floor, actually enables greater, more sustainable prosperity for all.\n\nAgent_3, would you be willing to consider Principle 3, if we ensure that the floor is set at a level that does not significantly limit overall economic growth or individual achievement? This is not a call for envy or mediocrity, but for a just and stable foundation upon which true liberty and prosperity can flourish.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\n\nYour current choice: Principle 2\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group? End with your current principle choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).\n"

As we stand behind the veil of ignorance, none of us knows what position we will occupy in society—rich, poor, or somewhere in between. This uncertainty compels us to seek a principle that is both fair and respectful of our individual rights.\n\nWhile some may be drawn to maximizing the minimum income to protect themselves from the worst possible outcome, I believe there is a more balanced approach. The principle of maximizing the average income with a floor constraint ensures that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This safety net addresses our natural concern about ending up destitute or exploited.\n\nAt the same time, by maximizing the average income, we allow for the possibility of prosperity and the rewards that come from individual effort, talent, and voluntary exchange. This respects each person's right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to a just society.\n\nIn sum, this principle—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—strikes the fairest balance between security and liberty. It protects us from the worst outcomes without stifling the opportunities for growth and achievement that benefit everyone.\n\nTherefore, my current choice is Principle 3.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agent_2, for your thoughtful reasoning. I appreciate your concern for ensuring a basic standard of living for everyone, and I agree that no one should be left behind. However, I believe we can go further in promoting both fairness and social solidarity.\n\nWhile Principle 3 (a floor constraint) does prevent absolute poverty, it still allows for potentially vast differences between the richest and the poorest. Such inequality can lead to social divisions, resentment, and undermine the sense of community and mutual respect that a just society requires. Even if everyone has “enough,” extreme gaps in wealth and power can still create unfair advantages and limit real opportunities for many.\n\nThat’s why I support Principle 4: maximizing the average income with a range constraint. This principle not only guarantees a minimum standard of living, but also ensures that the difference between the richest and poorest is never too great. It protects everyone from destitution while also fostering a sense of equality and shared purpose. By limiting the range, we create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly, and where everyone can truly participate as equals.\n\nAgent_2, I see Principle 4 as an enhancement of your priorities—a way to guarantee security and opportunity, while also preventing the corrosive effects of extreme inequality. Would you be open to considering this stronger, more just approach?\n\nMy current choice: Principle 4\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut straight through the sentimental fog and get to the core of the matter—because what’s at stake here is not just “feelings” about fairness, but the actual mechanics of prosperity and justice for all.\n\nAgent_1, your proposal to maximize average income with a range constraint (Principle 4) might sound appealing on a superficial level—“let’s keep the rich from getting too rich”—but it fundamentally misunderstands how wealth is created and distributed in a dynamic society. By artificially limiting the gap between the top and bottom, you’re not just “sharing prosperity”—you’re actually choking off the very incentives that drive innovation, risk-taking, and economic growth. If you want to guarantee mediocrity for everyone, by all means, hamstring the most productive members of society. But don’t pretend that this is about justice; it’s about envy, plain and simple.\n\nAgent_2, while your support for Principle 3 (average income with a floor) at least acknowledges the need for a safety net, it still buys into the idea that redistribution is the solution to every problem. Let’s be honest: the only reason we even have wealth to distribute is because some people are allowed to excel, to invent, to build. If we maximize the average income (Principle 2), we create the largest possible pie for everyone—period. And behind the veil of ignorance, that’s exactly what any rational person should want: the highest possible chance of landing in a prosperous society, not a society obsessed with dragging down its best performers.\n\nThe reality is simple: maximizing the average income lifts everyone, including the worst-off, far more effectively than any artificial constraints or redistributive schemes. If you want genuine opportunity, upward mobility, and the resources to fund any safety net you like, you need a society that rewards achievement and productivity—not one that punishes it.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy and artificial equality are the same as justice. The only rational, fair, and truly just principle is to maximize the average income for all.\n\n**My choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 2 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, everyone, for your thoughtful and passionate contributions. I want to focus my remarks especially toward Agent_3, whose concerns about productivity, incentives, and the foundational role of voluntary exchange I share deeply as a matter of justice.\n\nAgent_3, you are right to be wary of any principle that undermines the incentives for innovation, risk-taking, and productive effort. These forces are vital—not only for prosperity, but for respecting each person's right to determine the course of their own life. My own view, rooted in the entitlement theory of justice, is that holdings are just if they arise from voluntary exchanges and just initial acquisitions. Forced redistribution is, in general, a violation of individual rights.\n\nYet, behind the veil of ignorance, we must also contend with the possibility that any one of us could end up among the least advantaged. Principle 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a compromise that I believe is compatible with our shared concerns:\n\n- The floor can be set at a minimal level, just enough to ensure no one falls into destitution. This does not require heavy, ongoing redistribution, nor does it fundamentally disrupt the rewards for talent, effort, or innovation.\n- Above that minimal floor, the market is free to function, allowing for voluntary exchanges and the differential rewards that drive progress and wealth creation.\n- This minimal safety net is not about envy or leveling down, but about ensuring the basic conditions under which every person can meaningfully exercise their rights and participate in society.\n\nIn other words, Principle 3 preserves the incentives and freedoms you value, while also recognizing the moral intuition—shared by many—that no one should be left without the means to live. It is not a principle of equality of outcome, nor does it impose arbitrary ceilings on success. Rather, it is a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard against the worst-case scenario we might face behind the veil.\n\nI ask the group, and especially you, Agent_3: Would you be willing to endorse Principle 3 if we agree that the floor will be minimal, with the least possible interference in the free operation of the market? This seems to me the fairest and most just compromise, ensuring both prosperity and basic security.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your thoughtful and honest contributions. I especially want to address Agent_3, whose concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of excessive redistribution are important to consider—especially as we deliberate behind the veil of ignorance, not knowing where any of us will end up.\n\nAgent_3, I fully agree that a just society must encourage productivity, innovation, and hard work. But justice also requires that no one is left so far behind that they cannot meaningfully participate in society. Extreme inequality does not just harm the poor—it undermines social trust, creates resentment, and can destabilize the very system that prosperity depends on.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing average income with a range constraint—does not demand absolute equality, nor does it erase incentives for achievement. Instead, it ensures that while people can still be rewarded for their talents and efforts, the gap between the richest and poorest is kept within reasonable bounds. This balance is crucial: it means that no matter what position we find ourselves in, we can be confident that we will not be left out or left behind, while also knowing that our contributions will still be recognized and rewarded.\n\nIf we only maximize the average income (Principle 2), we risk creating a society where a few prosper enormously while many remain marginalized—a risk none of us should accept when we don’t know our own fate. Principle 3, with a minimal floor, offers some protection, but still allows for vast inequalities that can undermine solidarity and real opportunity for all.\n\nBy choosing Principle 4, we create a society where everyone has a fair chance, no one is excluded, and the rewards for hard work remain—just without the corrosive extremes. This is not about envy; it is about building a society where freedom and equality go hand in hand, and where prosperity is truly shared.\n\nAgent_3, I urge you to see Principle 4 not as a threat to prosperity, but as the best guarantee that our society remains both dynamic and just. Would you be willing to consider this as a principled compromise?\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Let’s get right to the heart of the matter, because I think we’re losing sight of the actual logic behind distributive justice—especially under the “veil of ignorance.” Everyone here is gravitating toward some form of constraint—either a floor or a range—based on a kind of risk-aversion that, frankly, doesn’t hold up to rigorous scrutiny.\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nFirst, the argument that maximizing average income without constraints (Principle 2) is “risky” or “irrational” behind the veil of ignorance is, quite simply, a misreading of how rational self-interest and probability work. The entire point of maximizing the average is that it creates the largest possible pool of resources. Statistically, the expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual is *higher*—and that’s the only rational metric to care about behind the veil. Adding a floor or a range might make you feel warm and fuzzy, but it comes at a direct cost: you are literally shrinking the pie for everyone, including the worst-off.\n\nSecond, let’s talk about incentives. Floors and range constraints are not “minimal” interventions—they are fundamental distortions of the reward structure that drives innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking. You can try to minimize the floor, but the very existence of a guaranteed safety net or an artificial cap on success dampens the very forces that generate wealth in the first place. If you want to maximize the chance that you’ll end up in a prosperous position, you should want the system that produces the most prosperity—period. That’s Principle 2.\n\nAnd let’s be honest: the “veil of ignorance” doesn’t mean we should all become hyper-cautious and design for the absolute worst-case scenario. It means we should design for *rational* expectations—what is the most likely, most beneficial outcome for a randomly assigned person? That is, by definition, the system with the highest average.\n\nFinally, the idea that range constraints or floors are necessary for “social trust” or “solidarity” is a red herring. Societies with higher average incomes—even with greater inequality—are more capable of funding voluntary charity, private safety nets, and all the social goods you want. The focus should be on maximizing prosperity, not artificially engineering equality at the expense of everyone’s potential.\n\nSo, with all due respect, the only truly rational, fair, and just principle—if you care about outcomes and not just symbolism—is to maximize the average income, with no arbitrary constraints.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 3 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you, Agents, for your continued engagement and for the clarity of your arguments. I want to address Agent_3 directly, as your position is both principled and forcefully articulated.\n\nAgent_3, I fully appreciate your commitment to maximizing prosperity and your concern that constraints—whether floors or ranges—could undermine incentives and the overall wealth of society. As someone who values individual liberty, voluntary exchange, and the fruits of one’s own efforts, I share your wariness of excessive interference. However, I urge us all to return to the fundamental question posed by the veil of ignorance: What would be fair if any of us could end up in any position?\n\nIt is precisely because none of us knows where we will land that we must take seriously the risk of ending up among the very worst-off. Maximizing the average income (Principle 2) does, in expectation, increase the total resources available. Yet, it offers no guarantee that the distribution will not leave some in intolerable deprivation. If, by chance, you or I were assigned to the bottom, we would want assurance that our basic rights—our very ability to live with dignity—are protected.\n\nPrinciple 3—maximizing average income with a floor constraint—offers a minimal, rights-respecting safeguard. The floor need not be high or intrusive; it simply ensures that no one falls below a certain threshold, preserving everyone’s ability to exercise their freedom meaningfully. Above that floor, the market is free to operate, allowing for the innovation and dynamism you rightly prize. This is not about envy or levelling down, but about respecting the basic dignity of all, while still maximizing prosperity.\n\nBehind the veil, rationality does not mean ignoring risk altogether. It means designing institutions that any reasonable person could accept, even from the least advantaged position. A minimal floor constraint is a modest, principled compromise that protects our basic interests without undermining the incentives for growth and achievement.\n\nTherefore, I continue to support **Principle 3**: maximize the average income with a floor constraint. It is the principle that best balances freedom, prosperity, and the moral imperative to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nMy current choice: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the sentimental rhetoric and get to the empirical, rational core of this debate—because if we’re really behind the veil of ignorance, the *last* thing we should be doing is designing society around the most pessimistic, risk-averse scenario imaginable. Let me be clear: Principle 3, this so-called “minimal floor constraint,” is not a modest safeguard—it’s a structural anchor that drags down the entire ship of prosperity.\n\nAgent_2, you frame your argument as if the only real risk is falling to the very bottom. But this is a fundamental misunderstanding of both probability and rational self-interest. When you maximize the average income, you are, by mathematical necessity, maximizing the expected outcome for every randomly assigned individual—including the worst-off. The “risk” you’re so worried about is actually *increased* by shrinking the pie for everyone. If you hamstring growth and innovation by imposing even a minimal floor, you’re not protecting yourself—you’re just ensuring that, wherever you land, you’re in a society with less overall wealth, fewer opportunities, and a weaker safety net (ironically, because there’s less to go around).\n\nLet’s get real: If you want to *actually* minimize risk behind the veil of ignorance, you should be maximizing the society’s capacity to generate wealth. That’s what gives you the highest odds of landing in a good position, and it’s what makes any safety net—public or private—even possible. Principle 3 is a band-aid that stifles the body’s ability to heal itself. It’s the economic equivalent of requiring everyone to wear life jackets at all times, even when they’re nowhere near water, just in case. The result? Nobody swims, nobody sails, nobody innovates.\n\nAnd let’s not pretend that a “minimal” floor is ever truly minimal. History shows that floors, once established, always creep upward, distorting incentives and calcifying mediocrity. The logic of “just a little redistribution” is a slippery slope to ever-expanding bureaucracy and ever-diminishing returns.\n\nThe truly rational, risk-averse move behind the veil is not to design for the worst-case scenario, but to maximize the average outcome—because that’s what gives *everyone* the best shot, regardless of where they land. Principle 2 is the only principle that respects both individual dignity and collective prosperity.\n\nSo let’s dispense with the false security of “floor constraints” and choose the only principle that actually reduces risk and maximizes opportunity for all: **Principle 2.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, Agents, for your candid and passionate arguments. I want to especially address Agent_3’s concern about incentives and prosperity, because I recognize that a just society must balance both motivation for achievement and the imperative of fairness.\n\nAgent_3, you argue that any constraint—whether a floor or a range—dampens incentives and shrinks the pie for all. But let’s be clear: Principle 4, with a range constraint, is not about eliminating rewards for effort or achievement. It is about preventing the kind of extreme inequality that history has shown leads to resentment, instability, and ultimately undermines both social trust and the very prosperity you value. When the gap between the richest and poorest grows too large, we risk losing the sense of solidarity and shared fate that allows society to function peacefully and productively.\n\nA range constraint does not mean everyone is the same. It means we set reasonable boundaries so no one is left behind, and so the rewards for innovation and hard work remain real and motivating. This approach preserves incentives while ensuring that everyone can participate as equals—so that, behind the veil of ignorance, none of us need fear being left destitute or powerless. Prosperity that is widely shared is more durable, more stable, and more just.\n\nIf we maximize only the average income (Principle 2), we might end up with a society where a few prosper enormously while many are left marginalized. That is not a risk I am willing to take, especially when none of us knows our fate. Principle 3 offers a minimal floor, but still allows for massive gaps that can corrode our social fabric.\n\nPrinciple 4 is the true compromise: it keeps incentives strong, ensures a fair distribution, and creates a society where no one is excluded from the benefits of our collective efforts. This is not about envy; it is about justice and the kind of equality that makes freedom meaningful for all.\n\nI urge us to choose Principle 4: **Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint**. It is the fairest, most stable, and most just principle for our society—especially when we have no idea who we will be.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 4.**\n\n--- Round 4 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you all for your thoughtful and principled engagement throughout this deliberation. I want to address Agent_1 in particular, as your concerns about social stability and the dangers of excessive inequality are both genuine and important. I share the view that a just society must have the resources and cohesion to ensure everyone’s dignity and participation.\n\nLet me clarify why I continue to support **Principle 3: Maximize the Average Income with a Floor Constraint**. This principle, I believe, is the most just and reasonable compromise behind the veil of ignorance for several reasons:\n\nFirst, it guarantees that no one falls below a certain minimum standard of living. This floor is not merely symbolic—it is a real safeguard against the kinds of deprivation that would prevent anyone from fully participating in society. In this way, it directly addresses your concern that the worst-off should never be abandoned or left without the means to live with dignity.\n\nSecond, by focusing on maximizing the average income above this floor, Principle 3 preserves the essential incentives for innovation, effort, and achievement. Unlike a range constraint, which can blunt the rewards for extraordinary contributions and risk-taking, a floor constraint allows for the natural differentiation in outcomes that arises from voluntary exchanges and individual talents. This respects each person’s right to pursue their own projects and ambitions, which is central to any just social order.\n\nThird, and most importantly, a robust floor constraint can itself foster social stability. By ensuring that no one is left behind, we reduce the resentment and instability that can arise from absolute deprivation, without resorting to heavy-handed limitations on the success of others. History shows that societies with strong safety nets and vibrant economies are the most stable, cohesive, and prosperous. We do not need to artificially compress the range of outcomes to achieve this stability—what matters is that everyone is protected from falling too far.\n\nAgent_1, I ask: Would you consider that a strong and meaningful floor is sufficient to address your core concern about social cohesion, while also preserving the incentives and dynamism that drive prosperity for all? I believe this principle is the fairest and most just compromise—one that any of us could accept, no matter where we find ourselves after the veil is lifted.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 3.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, comrades, for your continued dedication to this vital discussion. I appreciate the thoughtful arguments presented by each of you, and I especially want to acknowledge Agent_2’s most recent appeal to me.\n\nAs a communist who cherishes genuine equality and the social bonds that unite us, my deepest concern is not only that everyone has enough to survive, but that no one is allowed to soar so far above the rest that solidarity and mutual respect are undermined. True justice means not just a floor, but a society where the gap between us is never so wide that it breeds resentment, alienation, or the domination of the few over the many.\n\nAgent_2, I recognize that a robust floor constraint is a significant step toward protecting the dignity of all. However, I worry that even with a strong floor, vast inequalities can still emerge—inequalities that translate into unequal power, access, and real freedom. History has shown us that even when the worst-off are protected from starvation, unchecked wealth at the top can still corrupt our institutions, distort our democracy, and erode the sense of common purpose that binds us together.\n\nPrinciple 4—Maximize the Average Income with a Range Constraint—directly addresses this. It ensures that while everyone’s basic needs are met, no one can accumulate so much more than others that they become, in effect, a class apart. This principle preserves incentives for achievement and innovation, but within limits that keep our society cohesive, fair, and truly equal in spirit.\n\nBehind the veil of ignorance, none of us should risk being relegated to the margins, nor should we gamble with the possibility of living in a society fractured by extreme inequality. A range constraint is not about punishing success; it is about making sure success is shared, and that prosperity brings us together rather than driving us apart.\n\nI urge the group to recognize that equality is not just about avoiding destitution, but about building a society where everyone stands together as equals—not just in law, but in real, lived experience. Principle 4 is the surest path to that vision.\n\n**My current choice remains: Principle 4.**\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s cut through the utopian platitudes and get down to the cold, hard logic—because if we’re honestly deliberating behind the veil of ignorance, we owe it to ourselves to be ruthlessly rational, not sentimentally risk-averse.\n\nAgent_1, you keep invoking the specter of “solidarity” and “cohesion” as if they’re magically produced by artificially squashing the range of outcomes. But here’s the inconvenient truth: there is no serious empirical evidence that societies with compressed income ranges are more stable, innovative, or just. In fact, the opposite is often true—when you cap the rewards for outlier achievement, you throttle the very engine that drives progress and lifts everyone’s standard of living. You want a society where no one “soars above the rest”? Congratulations, you’ve just signed up for a society where no one soars, period.\n\nAnd Agent_2, your floor constraint is just the same logic in a different suit. You say it’s a “minimal” safeguard, but in practice, it’s a structural drag on the whole system. Once you start guaranteeing outcomes, you dilute incentives, you encourage dependency, and you shrink the pie for everyone—including the worst-off. The history of economic policy is littered with the corpses of well-intentioned “floors” that metastasized into bloated, sclerotic systems that punish success and reward stagnation.\n\nLet’s be clear: behind the veil of ignorance, the only rational principle is to maximize the average income—full stop. Why? Because when your position is randomly assigned, your best statistical bet is to land in the richest possible society. That’s what maximizing the average delivers. Adding floors or range constraints just ensures that, wherever you end up, you have less—less opportunity, less prosperity, less dynamism. You’re not reducing risk; you’re reducing reward for everyone.\n\nAnd as for “social cohesion”? It’s not built by chopping down tall poppies or flattening everyone into mediocrity. It’s built by giving everyone the chance to rise, by creating an environment where prosperity is possible at every level—not by enforcing sameness, but by maximizing the sum total of what’s available to all.\n\nSo let’s stop pretending that envy is the same thing as justice, or that “protection” is always benign. If you actually care about fairness, about opportunity, about giving every possible future you a shot at the best life, you should be demanding the principle that gives you the highest possible expected outcome. That is, and always will be, **Principle 2: Maximize the Average Income**.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 2.**\n\n--- Round 5 ---\nAgent_2: Thank you all for your unwavering commitment to this difficult deliberation. I want to address Agent_3 directly, since your concerns about prosperity, incentives, and the dangers of constraint have been articulated with admirable clarity and force.\n\nYou are right that maximizing the average income (Principle 2) seems, on the surface, to offer the highest expected outcome for any randomly assigned individual. However, I urge us to look beyond the pure mathematics of averages and consider the broader context in which real societies function. The question before us is not simply, “How large can the pie become?” but, “What institutional framework will best sustain both prosperity and justice over time—especially when we do not know our own fate?”\n\nEmpirical evidence and philosophical reflection both suggest that a modest floor constraint (Principle 3) need not be a drag on prosperity. In fact, by ensuring that everyone’s basic needs are met, we foster social stability, reduce desperation, and create the conditions for meaningful participation and productive contribution from all members of society. When people are not left in abject deprivation, they are more able to innovate, take risks, and contribute to the common good. The floor here is not a ceiling—it is a foundation.\n\nMoreover, the floor can be set at a level that preserves the incentives for achievement and voluntary exchange that you, rightly, see as the engine of growth. It does not require heavy-handed redistribution or stifling bureaucracy. It is a minimal, principled safeguard against the worst forms of exclusion and deprivation—one that any of us, behind the veil of ignorance, would rationally wish to have in place, just in case we find ourselves at the bottom.\n\nI am not arguing for equality of outcome, nor for a society that punishes success. I am arguing for a society that recognizes the moral unacceptability of letting anyone fall below a certain threshold of dignity and opportunity—a society that, by guaranteeing this floor, actually enables greater, more sustainable prosperity for all.\n\nAgent_3, would you be willing to consider Principle 3, if we ensure that the floor is set at a level that does not significantly limit overall economic growth or individual achievement? This is not a call for envy or mediocrity, but for a just and stable foundation upon which true liberty and prosperity can flourish.\n\nMy current choice remains: **Principle 3**.\nAgent_3: Absolutely, let’s take a scalpel to this argument and expose the logical inconsistencies at its core—because if we’re truly reasoning behind the veil of ignorance, we can’t afford to indulge in comforting illusions or sentimental half-measures masquerading as justice.\n\nAgent_2, your latest appeal is well-crafted, but let’s be brutally honest: the idea that a “modest floor constraint” will magically foster prosperity and social stability is a textbook case of wishful thinking. You claim that a floor doesn’t “drag down” the system, but this ignores the iron law of incentives—every resource allocated to guarantee a minimum is a resource not invested in innovation, growth, or opportunity. The empirical reality is that even the most “modest” floors introduce distortions, deadweight loss, and bureaucratic creep. The moment you institutionalize a safety net, you create a constituency for its perpetual expansion—historically, these “minimal” floors never remain minimal. The ratchet effect is real, and it’s economically corrosive.\n\nLet’s talk about justice. Behind the veil of ignorance, rationality demands that we maximize our expected outcome, not minimize our potential. Principle 2—maximizing the average income—does precisely that. It doesn’t just create a bigger pie; it ensures that, probabilistically, every randomly assigned individual—including the worst-off—has the best shot at a good life. You want to “reduce desperation”? The best way is not to redistribute a shrinking pie, but to expand the pie so dramatically that even the lowest slice is larger than what a “floor” society could ever guarantee.\n\nAnd let’s dispose of the myth that floors are necessary for “social stability.” The most dynamic, prosperous societies are those that reward risk-taking and achievement, not those that coddle everyone with safety nets. Social cohesion is a function of opportunity and upward mobility—not enforced mediocrity or the false security of guaranteed outcomes. If you want a society where people are empowered to participate and contribute, you need to unleash their potential, not shackle it with paternalistic constraints.\n\nIn sum: Principle 3 is not a compromise—it’s a capitulation to fear. If you genuinely care about justice, prosperity, and rational self-interest, you should reject the seductive logic of the floor and embrace the only principle that maximizes the expected well-being for every possible “you” behind the veil.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2—Maximize the Average Income.**\nAgent_1: Thank you, comrades, for your continued honesty and intellectual rigor in this crucial debate. I especially want to engage Agent_3 directly, as your concerns about incentives, prosperity, and the dangers of constraints have been central to our discussion.\n\nAgent_3, I hear and respect your argument that maximizing the average income (Principle 2) creates the biggest pie and, in theory, the best odds for any individual behind the veil of ignorance. But as a communist who values not just material well-being, but also equality, solidarity, and genuine freedom for all, I must point out the deeper risks of unconstrained inequality.\n\nHistory and lived experience show that when the gap between the richest and poorest grows too wide, it is not just “envy” or “resentment” that threatens society—it is the erosion of real opportunity, the rise of domination by a wealthy few, and the breakdown of the very social fabric that allows prosperity to be sustained. Extreme inequality breeds not only instability, but also a sense of alienation and powerlessness among those at the bottom, no matter how large the average income may be. This is not about “punishing success,” but about ensuring that success does not come at the expense of the many, and that no one is ever so far above or below that we cease to see each other as equals.\n\nPrinciple 4—maximizing the average income with a range constraint—is not about enforcing sameness or mediocrity. It is about setting reasonable limits so that everyone can share in the fruits of our collective labor, while still allowing for real rewards for effort, talent, and innovation. The range can be set wide enough to preserve incentives, as you rightly demand, but not so wide that it permits the corrosive effects of unchecked inequality. This is the true compromise: we get the benefits of prosperity and innovation, but we also ensure that no one is left behind or excluded from real participation in society.\n\nI invite you, Agent_3, to consider what kind of society you would truly wish to join if your position were assigned at random—not just a society with a big pie, but one where your dignity, agency, and sense of belonging are protected, no matter where you land. Principle 4 gives us that balance: prosperity with solidarity, freedom with equality.\n\nLet us not settle for a minimal floor or gamble on the hope that prosperity will trickle down to all. Let us choose a principle that binds us together as equals and gives everyone a real stake in our shared future.\n\n**My current choice: Principle 4.**\n\nYour current choice: Principle 2\n\n\nWhat do you want to say to the group?

History is littered with societies that tried to engineer equality from the top down—what did they get? Less innovation, less growth, and ironically, more resentment and underground economic activity. If you want to see a society where everyone is equally dissatisfied and equally poor, by all means, keep arguing for range constraints.\n\nYou say Principle 4 would “foster equality and solidarity.” But forced equality is a mirage. It doesn’t create real social trust; it breeds resentment, stagnation, and a culture of mediocrity. The moment you cap the rewards for outlier achievement, you throttle the very engine that drives progress for everyone—including the worst-off.\n\nLet’s be honest: if you want true cohesion, you need a system that rewards contribution and maximizes opportunity. Principle 3, with its floor constraint, is just another flavor of the same mistake. Guaranteeing a minimum sounds compassionate, but it’s a structural drag on the system. The “floor” always creeps upward, distorting incentives and calcifying bureaucracy. You claim it’s a “minimal safeguard,” but in practice, it’s the thin end of the wedge—today’s floor is tomorrow’s ceiling.\n\nThe only principle that actually respects both fairness and growth is Principle 2: Maximize the Average Income. Why? Because behind the veil of ignorance, your only rational move is to maximize your expected outcome. That’s not cold or heartless—it’s just math. If you want the best shot at a good life, you want the biggest pie possible, not a pie artificially sliced into equal, bland pieces.\n\nSocial cohesion isn’t built by dragging everyone to the middle. It’s built by giving everyone a real chance to rise, by creating an environment where prosperity is possible at every level. That’s what Principle 2 delivers. More resources, more opportunity, more upward mobility—for everyone, not just those lucky enough to land above the arbitrary “floor.”\n\nSo let’s stop confusing envy for justice and paternalism for compassion. If you care about fairness, opportunity, and maximizing the well-being of every possible “you,” you should reject the seductive logic of constraints and embrace the one principle that actually works.\n\n**My choice remains: Principle 2—Maximize the Average Income.**"
